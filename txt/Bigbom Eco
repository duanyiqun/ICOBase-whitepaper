1. INTRODUCTION 

Bigbom Eco serves as a decentralized advertising ecosystem for all parties involved                       

in online advertising, inclusive of advertisers, service providers, content publishers,                   

advertising channels, platforms. Bigbom Eco is being developed using smart                   

contract, running on Ethereum blockchain. We are proud to say that all data linked                           

through Bigbom Eco is transparent, accurate, automated and immutable.  

The Bigbom Marketplace concentrates on all service suppliers, who are rated and                       

evaluated by Bigbom Eco, and service buyers transparently. The Buyer or Advertiser                       

is able to choose the most suitable service supplier basing on the rating and reviews.  

Bigbom iAds utilizes an auto-optimized advertising system on an array of channels,                       

such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Twitter. This system has been developed                       

with a self-developed algorithm which facilitates the automatic optimization of                   

advertisements, thus removing intermediaries in the decision-making process.               

Bigbom iAds will automatically deactivate those ads that exhibit a relatively lower                       

conversion rate, or incur higher cost prices than expected. Advertisers will be able to                           

manage ad campaigns according to KPIs, and the system will then automatically                       

allocate the budget towards efficient ads, campaigns and channels. This helps                     

advertisers conserving up to 80% of the campaign implementation effort while                     

decreasing the costs by as much as 20%. In return, this helps them increase their                             

return on investment (ROI).  

The goal of companies and advertisers is to maximize their marketing impact while                         

minimizing their marketing costs. In order to reach this goal, they have to target the                             

3 



 

right audience, who needs or matches the ad and using the right channel at the right                               

time. 

2. VISION AND PURPOSE 

 
Bigbom Eco is the first digital advertising ecosystem built as a decentralized                       

application platform (DApp), which links ad platforms and publishers to advertisers                     

globally. We aim to solve the trouble of truth between advertising buyers and sellers                           

by using blockchain technology. We aim to free up human resources in online                         

marketing optimize costs and increase the effect of advertising campaigns through                     

the development of Bigbom iAds, an advertising automation utility which abilities to                       

self-learning and optimizing ads bidding on many popular platforms. 

In next 5 years, Bigbom Eco aims to become an ecosystem with a significant                           

influence on the global online advertising industry. 

3. MARKET OVERVIEW 

Approximately 50 million new businesses are established around the world (by                     

Moyak, 2016). This leads to an increased level of competition in all fields day-by-day.                           

As the competitiveness increases, the advertising/marketing demand increases               

sharply. Simultaneously, online advertising technology has dramatically evolved in                 

recent years, thanks to preeminent advantages over traditional advertising, such as                     

the possibility to target ads more specifically, a higher measurement accuracy and                       

lower costs. As a result, annual revenue of the online advertising industry continues                         

to grow strongly. In 2017, online advertising accounted for 41% of global advertising                         

expenditure and is forecasted to increase in the coming years (Magna, 2017).                       

4 



 

According to Magna (2017), worldwide advertising expenditure for digital channels                   

represents a $209 billion market, accounting for 41% of the advertising industry. It                         

has overtaken traditional advertising channels such as TV ads $178 billion                     

(accounting for 35% of the market). The shift towards digital advertising spending                       

demonstrates that brands and advertisers recognize the growing influence of online                     

advertising channels. Given the growth rate, Magna projects the expenditure of                     

digital advertising will grow by 13% to reach $237 billion in 2018 and $300 billion by                               

2020. 

 

 

Figure 1: Data for 2017 and beyond are forecasts (MAGNA) 

 

Another source, Statista.com estimates that digital advertising spending will reach                   

$269 billion in 2018 and $335 billion in 2020. 

Figure 1 further demonstrates that advertisers are shifting budgets from traditional                     

advertising markets to digital advertising market, and the level of spending on digital                         

advertising keeps rising rapidly. 

5 



 

According to global statistics, Google and Facebook are the leading providers of                       

online advertising worldwide with revenues $95.38 billion and $33.84 billion in 2017,                       

respectively (Statista.com, 2018). The figures show that Google and Facebook                   

account for nearly 20% of total global online advertising revenue. In addition, other                         

channels such as Twitter accounts for $3.26 billion in 2017 and estimated to have                           

speedy growth in the coming time (Statista, 2018). 

4. CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE MARKET 

The online advertising industry has grown exponentially in recent years, and is                       

projected to keep doing so in the coming years. Though, the team behind Bigbom                           

Eco found that the problems it had to deal with on a daily basis, were still the same                                   

ones as the problems it had to deal with during the industry’s infancy.  

Trust between advertising buyers (advertisers) and sellers (ads               

platform  publishers): 

Buyers: Buyers often waste time on selecting the right ads platform and suitable                         

publishers. Moreover, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of                       

advertising before actual implementation. This leads to uncertainty about the level of                       

efficiency and whether the KPIs promise by the sellers will be met. 

Sellers​: For sellers, there is a risk of non-payment, as they generally provide the                           

service before payment is completed. For instance, Google, Facebook and similar                     

platforms hosting ads are forced to lock their customers accounts, due to them not                           

having enough funds to cover transactions on due date. This may results in these                           

6 



 

customers being in debt to the platform, with debt collecting fees negatively                       

influencing the platform’s profit margin. 

Lacks of support for DApps through traditional marketplace solutions: 

With the emerging popularity of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, the                   

transition from traditional application to DApps occured in multiple industries, such                     

as entertainment and financial technology etc. However, the amount of marketplace                     

for advertisers and advertising platform/content provider is very limited. This                   

reduces the ability of expansion to potential customers in the digital money                       

economy.  

Manual management of ads is time-consuming and ineffective: 

Managing ads across multiple campaigns on multiple channels is time and labor                       

intensive. Clients may be able to reach thousands of users by setting up an ad on                               

Facebook, Google or Twitter, though there is a little control on the performance of                           

these ads without manual adjustment. In addition to manual adjustment being                     

necessary, advertising agencies are usually not working around the clock, which                     

means that there is no possibility of adjustments outside working hours.   

Suboptimal Advertising Budgeting 

Advertisers usually are able to measure and adjust their online ads spending only                         

inside the ads platform/publisher that their campaign is running. This does not                       

guarantee the budget is fully optimized. For example, when an advertiser evaluates                       

their results on the multiple platform such as Facebook & Google, there are some                           

ads is not having good performance on each platform. As a result, budgets will not                             

7 



 

be optimized for these specific ads. This means that the campaign is not as                           

successful as it could have been.  

 

These lead to the following questions: 

How to optimize budget when investing in advertising? 

How are the budgets among the different ad channels optimized? 

Bigbom has run over a thousand campaigns each year for many large companies,                         

including Baskin Robbins, Jockey, Lazada and VNG. Through their business, Bigbom                     

experienced first-hand which difficulties clients and users within the advertising                   

industry have to deal with. Even though talented teams and companies invest                       

significantly time, effort and money into their advertisement, the structure disallowed                     

them to reach a maximized return on investment. That is the reason why Bigbom Eco                             

was started. 

5. BIGBOM ECO - DECENTRALIZED 

ADVERTISING ECOSYSTEM 

5.1. What is Bigbom Eco? 
Bigbom Eco is a decentralized advertising ecosystem for all parties involved in online                         

advertising, including advertising, content publishers and advertising channels.               

Bigbom Eco is developed using smart contracts, running on the Ethereum blockchain                       

and Tomochain. All connected data via Bigbom Eco is transparent, accurate,                     

autonomous and immutable when data is posted  on blockchain. 

8 



 

Tomochain: 

Tomochain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum                       

blockchain. Tomochain plans to support horizontal scaling via adding more second                     

layer blockchains with good performance integrated with Ethereum for backup and                     

atomic cross-chain transfer. 

Bigbom has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Tomochain. With                     

this MOU, Bigbom Eco will receive advisory and technical support from Tomochain in                         

the development phase of Bigbom Eco. Bigbom Eco will experiment itself on                       

Tomochain for comparison about transaction speed, network fee and stability                   

against Ethereum. 

5.2. BBO Token 
BBO, implements using ERC-20 standard, is the main utility for transactions under                       

Bigbom Eco’s ecosystem. The reason we have our own token is we wanted to have                             

better ownership, and make it easier for users on the ecosystem. Relying to other                           

cryptocurrencies/tokens brings a lot of risk to Bigbom, since they can change their                         

own policy. advertisers can buy BBO tokens during the ICO or purchase it on                           

exchanges after the ICO is completed, or buying it directly from our reserve using                           

credit card (explained in next section).  

5.3. Ecosystem  
Any platform, service or product related to digital advertising around the world can                         

become a part of Bigbom Eco. They may be advertisers and publishers, and even ads                             

platforms may opt to integrate the Bigbom Ecosystem. 

9 



 

The infographic below describes the relationship between all parts of Bigbom                     

Ecosystem. Each member will have a specific benefits by joining into this                       

ecosystem. 

Figure 2: Bigbom Ecosystem 

 

 

10 



 

Easy engagement and cost effective for advertiser: 

Establish a contract with a few clicks.. No extra fee. The only fee is a small                               

transaction fee for the execution of the smart contract.  

Easy to choose your partner: 

Through ratings & reviews on smart contracts, advertisers can decide which                     

publisher is the best fit for their business Bigbom Eco Marketplace also provides                         

rich and transparent provisioning for each ads platform/publisher joining the                   

marketplace 

Fast & Reliable & Secure: 

With Ethereum network, a transaction usually takes around 15-30s for confirmation.                     

On Tomochain, this is less than 2 seconds. This is totally comparable with credit                           

card, but the fee is much less. With large transaction, one common method is wired                             

transfer, but it takes 3-5 days depends on many factors. Compare with                       

Ethereum/Tomochain, the transaction time is  x 216,000 faster. 

Decentralized network is a network consisting thousands of nodes, although there                     

are still some limitations in the implementation regarding the consesus protocol, but                       

project such as Ethereum and Tomochain is currently actively working on more                       

stable consensus protocol, such as Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake, which                         

provides more scalability and fault tolerance.  

Blockchain is secure by nature. Record in blockchain is immutable, meaning no one                         

could change it by any method. Users also own their private key, the only method to                               

access their account on blockchain.  

 

11 



 

Easy Engagement: 

The marketplace allows you to actively engage with advertisers, using Direct Offer or                         

participate to a Client Bidding Offer . In addition, our recommendation engine will                         

select and give best suggestions about which customer you should engage. 

All campaigns, many platforms, ONE place: 

Bigbom iAds allows you to connect with multiple different ads platform within a                         

single account. All your campaigns are now available under a single overview on                         

your computer. 

Reach you goal with minimized cost: 

Bigbom iAds allows you to connect with multiple different ads platform within a                         

single account. All your campaigns are now available under a single overview on                         

your computer. 

Crypto-ready: 

Bigbom Eco allows users to pay with their traditional payment methods, such as                         

creditcard. In practice, they will essentially buy BBO tokens from the BBO Reserve at                           

a rate 5% above market price, therefore minimizing impact on the overall value of the                             

BBO-token. In addition, these BBO tokens will be directly used within the system,                         

thereby further decreasing supply of the BBO token.  

6. TECHNOLOGY 

Ethereum & Tomochain 

The Ethereum network provides distributed ecosystems and smart contracts that                   

have been proven and widely used by many companies, including JP Morgan, Cisco                         

12 



 

Deloitte Credit Suisse, HP Enterprises. Ether (ETH), the Ethereum token has become                       

popular in recent years. Ethereum is the second largest coin in terms of market                           

capitalization, just after Bitcoin. Ethereum is also the largest smart contract platform                       

with the largest number of deployed contracts, approximately 18,000 smart                   

contracts (according to etherscan.io). 

In addition to Ethereum, Bigbom will develop its system in parallel on Tomochain.                         

Tomochain aims to solve the scalability problem within Ethereum, and plans to                       

support horizontal scaling. It does so, by adding more second layer blockchains,                       

allowing cross-chain transfer. Bigbom will work directly with Tomochain on this                     

integration. After pilot testing, Bigbom will opt which of the 2 solutions is the most                             

effective for its business. 

6.1. Smart Contract Execution 

The majority of the features on the Bigbom Marketplace are operated by smart                         

contract. When a party (advertiser) needs to use online advertising services from                       

service provider (ads platform/publisher), both parties will agree on the price and                       

specific commitment (KPIs) at the time signing smart contract. 

 
A full overview of the various stages incorporated into the smart contract can be                           
found below:  
 

 

13 



 

 

Figure 3 : 4 steps of smart contract execution 
 

6.2. Main contracts on the Bigbom Marketplace: 
 

Service Offer Contract:  

When the ads platform or publisher offer their services to customers, the Service                         

Offer Contract us used set start and end dates, KPI terms and payment terms                           

between both parties. Buyers will be able to review the information in advance, and                           

make a decision on whether they would like to move forward with the deal.  

 

Service Bidding Contract:  

Both advertisers and ads platform/publishers have the ability to create a Service                       

Bidding Contract. With the same type of service as in the Service Offer Contract,                           

participants will be able to make offers at the best prices, based on the term. After                               

the Service Bidding Contract is validated, whoever makes the highest bid will be                         

selected to execute the contract. 

 

Payment Contract:  

When an ads platform/publisher executes an advertising campaign for their                   

customers, all KPIs promised in Service Offer Contract/Service Bidding Contract will                     

14 



 

be tracked and recorded by Bigbom Eco. Ads platforms/publishers can only request                       

their customers to pay for BBOs when the KPI conditions have been met, and did not                               

exceed the time specified on the smart contract. 

 

Review/Rating Contract:  

In order to evaluate the quality of both parties, the Rating Contract will be used to                               

evaluate advertisers and ads platform/publisher. The evaluator will receive a bonus                     

with a certain amount of BBO as a reward.  

 

6.3. Bigbom Marketplace’s  Workflow: 
 
 
The Bigbom Marketplace is a place where all service providers are evaluated and                         

ranked by Bigbom Eco and serves buyers fairly and transparently. Advertisers are                       

able to select their service provider based on their ratings and previous reviews.  

 
When the contract ends, advertisers are encouraged to rate and review the service                         

providers. Advertisers who give reviews are rewarded a certain amount of BBO                       

tokens from the bonus fund. Only those who use a service provider, which can be                             

tracked through smart contracts, can give them a rating, which makes the ratings far                           

more accurate than other review platforms. 

 

The advertisers can see ratings and reviews on the Ratings page. The advertisers                         

can compare between ratings left by other Buyers and ratings that are automatically                         

generated by the system. The thorough and unbiased rating information helps                     

Buyers selecting better quality service providers. 

 

The higher the service provider is ranked, the higher they will appear on the Ratings 

page. Being listed higher helps the Seller attract more customers and motivates 

the Seller to improve their services and advertising effectiveness.

automatically adjusts them in real time. 

● Automatically raises and lowers bidding on ad channels. 

● Automatically turns off ads that are not performing well or have a low                         

conversion rate. 

● Automatically allocates budget between channels in real time, based on                   

campaign performance. 

● Tailoring ad audience suggestions. 

● Automatically performs A/B testing over hundreds of ads to find the best ads,                         

landing pages, and ad objectives. 

● Making it easy for advertisers to manage and compare multi-channel data by                       

providing synchronized, real-time reporting on all channels.

How does Bigbom iAds reduce up to 80% of human costs and decrease the                           

advertising costs by  as much as 20%? 

 

Other systems on the market rely on simple “if, else” rules for optimizing their                           

advertisements. With Bigbom iAds, advertisers only need to enter their desired                     

bid and Bigbom will automatically optimize campaigns using clever and                   

sophisticated algorithms. 

 

Bigbom iAds will create multiple ad placements at the same time, reducing ad                         

creation time by 80%.  

 

Figure 6: Bigbom iAds’s permutation algorithm 

 

Bigbom iAds uses a series of smart algorithms to make the most cost-effective and                           

optimal bids for each ad. 

 

19 



 

A/B testing helps advertisers find the right audience for each ad. Based on the                           

results from this test, the system automatically allocates the ad budget for the best                           

audience. 

 

The system automatically creates or cancels ads based on each ad’s effectiveness.                       

Ads are automatically evaluated against the advertiser’s KPIs. This helps advertising                     

agencies spend less time monitoring ads.

7. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS 

In the past years, the cryptocurrency industry has seen multiple projects utilizing 

blockchain technology in an attempt to solve the issues the traditional advertising 

industry faces. However, previous projects such as Adex, Indahash and Adhive are 

structurally different from Bigbom Eco. Bigbom Eco has been purposely made as a 

20 



 

decentralized ecosystem with variety of solutions offered including Smart Contracts, 

Marketplace and Bigbom iAds. Other platforms platforms are essentially advertising 

platforms 

 

This means, that technically these platforms could become a target audience for                       

Bigbom Eco in the future.

10. PARTNERS 

 

Figure 8: List of current Bigbom’s Partnership 

 

11. ROADMAP 

Our primary focus is Bigbom iAds and Bigcom Eco development. We will open our                           

Beta version of Bigbom iAds as MVP before ICO date.  

 

Below is our roadmap, including our key milestones for technical and business                       

development.Dates and activities may be subject to change. 

 

 

Figure 9:  Bigbom’s roadmap 

25 



 

12. MARKET EXPANSION 

Our development strategy is different depending on each stage of the project. In the                           

first phase, we focus on expanding markets in Asia (excluding China) and the United                           

States. Then, we will expand to other markets in Europe, India and China. In order to                               

accelerate the market expansion, we will promote the cooperation of Bigbom with                       

professional and popular advertising partners in the targeted markets. To be clear,                       

we use the "Network Growth" Fund to maximize our partners' participation in the                         

Bigbom Eco ecosystem, and will provide a free fixed amount of time to attract more                             

advertisers using BigBom iAds. 

 

In general, we will expand in different markets depending on the capital we gain                           

during the ICO period. 

 

Figure 10: Market expansion based on raised funds

13. TOKEN 

13.1. Token Sale 

BBO will be issued as ERC-20 compatible token. Only 15% token is available for                           

public sale. Rest of tokens will be frozen, in order to maintain low circulating supply,                             

before our products enter stable condition. 

Our token sale will happen from 10 April 2018 10:00:00 GMT. Rest of details can be                               

found in the table below: 

 

Figure 11: Token sale details 

Note: We do not guarantee that all investors will be able to purchase BBO tokens during the                                 

ICO period. To ensure legality, investors need to provide personal information (KYC) to be                           

included in the whitelist. We reserve the right to refuse investment from citizens from certain                             

countries that have laws prohibiting ICOs or have other relevant regulations. By carefully                         

following legal processes, we will make it easier for BBO tokens to be listed on major                               

international exchanges. 

27 



 

13.2. Token Allocation 

Most of the Tokens is allocated in Reserve (31,75%) and Network Growth (30%).                         

Network Growth: Primarily for attracting new advertisers, ads platforms/publishers                 

into the ecosystem. We will not release all the tokens at once, instead we will                             

develop a plan to release the token, depends on ecosystem’s development.  

Reserve: We plan to let customer pay for their services on our ecosystem by                           

traditional payment method, like credit card. In practice, they will essentially buy                       

BBO tokens from the BBO Reserve at a rate 5% above market price, therefore                           

minimizing impact on the overall value of the BBO-token. In addition, these BBO                         

tokens will be directly used within the system, thereby further decreasing supply of                         

the BBO token. 

After contract is deployed, all Tokens that is not belong to Token Sale phase will be                               

sending to a Ethereum Multisig Wallet, and we will frozen this amount until ICO                           

ended. A vesting period up to 36 months is also being applied for Core Founders &                               

Core Staff and Advisors.

followed the business objectives. Because of that, we will have a slight change in                           

how we allocate funds to suit the actual situation.

15. MARKETING CAMPAIGN AND PR 
It is certain that the most effective marketing is word of mouth. In order to do this,                                 

Bigbom’s main focus will be on developing the best product possible, and bringing                         

30 



 

the most benefit to the users. As a result, Bigbom anticipates they will be happy to                               

introduce Bigbom Eco to others. In addition, by enhancing promotion, advertising, or                       

being as sponsorship of relevant events in targeted markets will also extremely                       

assist in boosting the Bigbom Eco brand. 

 

Bigbom aims to build a library with the goal of providing advertisers with the best                             

possible experience in products / services in the ecosystem. In addition, customers                       

and VIP partners can be supported directly by Bigbom team. 

 

More important, Bigbom will cooperate globally with influencers in the field of online                         

advertising and pre-coding, to deliver our message to potential clients and partners. 

16. REVENUE FORECASTS 
 

Before focusing on revenue, our strategy at the first stage will focus on maximizing 

the number of advertisers and partners participating in Bigbom Eco and Bigbom iAds 

to expand market share.  

 

There are two main sources of revenue: 

Revenue comes from Bigbom Eco Marketplace: 

Bigbom helps ad platforms/publishers gain more new and potential customers. At                     

the same time, they will share with us 3-5% of their revenue. 

 

Note​: For ad alatform / publisher only use smart contract, but do not join the                             

marketplace of Bigbom Eco will not require to pay any fee for us. 

 

Bigbom iAds Revenue: 

Our solution purposely helps advertisers save maximum human resources while 

increasing efficiency and reducing costs. The fee for using BigBom iAds will be 

between 3-5% based on total spending. As the total cost  advertisers can save up to 

20-25% or even larger, this is a perfectly fitting fee. 

 

Global advertisers on the Facebook platform and Google, etc. are also potential 

customers of Bigbom iAds.

downward. Besides, data on Global Ad Platforms and Marketing Technologies has a                       

gradual decline (​Chiefmartech.com, 2013-2017). 

 

17. RISK ANALYSIS 
We perform risk analysis based on 3 major area: Technology, Market and Legislation.                         

The analysis relies on our more than 10 years in this industry, and our experience on                               

blockchain technology since 2016 

32 



 

 
Technology​: ​What is your risks in terms of technology? 

Stability of decentralized network, especially Ethereum: 

We had anticipated that the decentralized network itself is till in early-stage, it could                           

be changed, transformed, or completely disappears without notice. Even we’re                   

developing our solution on Ethereum platform, the largest smart contract platform in                       

current time being, there’s no guarantee that Ethereum will head to its current plan. A                             

dencentralized network is running by community, and very fagile in terms of                       

regulation, so we cannot expecting consistency at this moment.  

Risk Rating​: AVERAGE 

 

Despite this situation, Bigbom believes that smart contract platform has huge                     

potential in the future. Smart contract development still has a lot of space for                           

improvement, innovation. In any circumstances, our solution only can become better,                     

with the evolution of the smart contract technology. 

Impact​:​ LOW 

 

Marketplace​: advertisers and partners are not willing to use the Bigbom 

Marketplace and  Bigbom iAds. 

 

Bigbom iAds is convinced to be able to attract advertisers to their platforms, 

because of several reasons: 

The Bigbom Marketplace  solves the trust issues which are currently occurring in 

traditional systems. Bigbom Marketplace is  safe and secure, and severely reduces 

the risk of fraudulent transactions. In addition, it reduces the risk of deferred 

payment from advertisers.  

 

The Bigbom iAds saves up to 80% in terms of effort and 20% in terms of efficiency,                                 

will be a significant attractor. 

 

Finally, Bigbom will create a user-friendly experience which will be easy to use.  

Risk​ ​Rating​: LOW 

Impact​: None 

 

33 



 

Legislation​: If countries prohibit the use of tokens as intermediary payment assets. 

 

This is a common problem for multiple companies involved in Cryptocurrency.                     

Bigbom Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based company, a country with an advanced and                       

transparent legal system, and has been supportive of cryptocurrencies. In case the                       

growth of Bigbom Eco is hampered by legal issues, Bigbom may consider to move                           

operations to other countries.  

Risk Rating​: LOW 

Impact​:​ LOW 

 

Business​: ​Market expanding difficulties 

 

Each market has different size, culture, legistation and geographic. Expanding into a 

new market requires  a lot of research, networking, presence establishment. Only by 

challenging these problems seriously, a company is able to successfully expand their 

business into other markets. 

Risk Rating​: ​AVERAGE  

 

We will use raised funds for investment into market research, legal assistance, and                         

opening our representative in upcoming markets. With our current experience in                     

advertising industry, and support from our high-profile advisors, we don’t see any big                         

obstacles regarding this problem. 

Impact​: LOW 

 

18. FAQS 
   

How can advertisers and investors purchase BBO tokens? 

BBO tokens can be purchased during the Private Sale, Pre-ICO, and ICO. BBO tokens                           

may also be purchased on an exchange after the ICO closes.   

 

How will Bigbom increase the value of BBO tokens over time?  

34 



 

The value of BBO will be decided by market, the higher the demand, the higher the                               

value of BBO will be reflected. Our primary target is attracting thousands of                         

advertisers and ads platform/publisher into our ecosystem, generating high volume                   

of transaction. As a result, there will be a high demand for BBO token in the market.                                 

Our product development is progressing well, and we are able to release our                         

products in 6 months after ICO ended. 

 

In addition, the total supply of BBO is fixed and unchanged over time. 

 

What is the fee per transaction when using smart contract? 

The fee will be determined by the Ethereum Network. We’re working on a scheme for                             

letting anyone able to execute our contracts, giving them right to choose the gas                           

price that suit them.   

 

The value of BBO can change during a contract’s duration. How will Bigbom                         

reduce risk for the ads platform/publisher? 

This is a common problem for the whole cryptocurrency market. When a person                         

accepts payment through Bitcoin or Ethereum, they accept that the value of these                         

coins may change over time. Bigbom is committed to develop a strong Bigbom Eco                           

following in the long-term. If successful, demand for the BBO tokens will increase,                         

which has a positive long-term effect on the tokens. Though, for those cases where                           

users may appreciate more stability, Bigbom Eco will be linked with cryptocurrency                       

converters so that investors and partners can quickly convert BBO tokens to USD or                           

other at currencies.  

 

How are the Campaign Reports generated, and how accurate are they? 

With institutions capable of delivering reports through the API, Bigbom Eco will                       

integrate with their APIs to collect information about the advertising campaign and                       

provide advertisers. 

 

For organizations that do not have the ability to provide reports through the API, the                             

advertiser will negotiate with the provider on the authenticity of the campaign                       

results. Examples of such method are Google Analytics and  Appsflyer. 

 

35 



 

Do all countries share the same problems between advertiser and ads                     

platform/publisher in the online advertising industry? Which benefits does the ads                     

platform/publisher receive by participating in Bigbom Eco? 

Depending on the country, the proportion of unpaid customer accounts is around 4                         

to 8%. This is a huge loss of revenue compared to the 0.1% charge of Bigbom Eco                                 

(2.5 to 5% compared to total loss). Therefore, ads platform/publisher are expected to                         

have a significant revenue gain by using Bigbom Eco. In addition, as the community                           

of BBO advertisers grows, ads platform/publisher will have more opportunities to                     

acquire new customers through the Bigbom Marketplace.  

 

Why should advertiser choose ads platform/publisher on the Bigbom Eco                   

Ecosystem? What are the benefits?  

First, Bigbom Eco will use a smart contract to guarantee maximum benefits for the                           

Buyer. The ecosystem’s marketplace allows advertisers to easily search for and                     

select service providers. Advertisers can make informed decisions by reviewing the                     

service providers’ ratings. The ratings are provided by the Bigbom system and other                         

advertisers, and are transparent, objective and accurate.  

Second, once Bigbom Eco is fully developed and used widely, it will become a                           

common platform for all parties in the online advertising industry. Being a part of this                             

ecosystem will be an advantage for all advertisers, and platforms who seek new                         

customers, partners and  service providers. 

 

Where is Bigbom based? 

Bigbom Limited is a British Virgin Island based company (BVI Company No                       

1971098). BigBom Limited is the parent company of Bigbom Pte Ltd, a                       

Singapore-based company (UEN No 201801349C). Both companies are               

headquartered at ​160 Robinson Road​, SBF Center, # 26-10, Singapore 068914. 

 

BigBom Limited is the issuer of BBO token whereby BigBom Pte Ltd will be in charge                               

of business development including building the network of Advertising Agencies that                     

will join the BigBom Ecosystem. 

 

If Facebook or Google temporarily suspend all ad APIs and change the distribution                         

algorithm then why?
