Business value chains are witnessing an inescapable shift towards fully digital transactions. The 
multitude of data available in real-time (Big Data) will increasingly be used to optimize these value 
chains by harnessing artificial intelligence and robotics.  

Any value chain (B2B, B2C, etc.) is basically composed of three major “flows”: (i) the flow of goods 
and services; (ii) the flow of information; (iii) the flow of payments. Efficiency is the name of the 
game, i.e. optimizing all three flows means reaching maximum efficiency (“efficiency singularity”) in 
terms of optimal (faster, cheaper, better) distribution of goods/services within the value chain – 
from suppliers to customers, which in turn requires efficient sharing and transfer of information and 
payments among the participants of a given value chain.

Value chains with centralized organizations can theoretically reach such efficiency singularity, while 
value chains with (partially) decentralized, independent organizations are very often not able to opti-
mally work together (in sharing goods/services, information and payments), mainly because of lack 
of trust. As a consequence, trillions in value get lost every year due to inefficiencies in the mentioned 
flows.

While A.I. algorithms can already optimize the flow of goods and services within value chains which 
include decentralized organizations (“Mixed Value Chains”), so far no groundbreaking technology 
was available to solve the issue of trustless participants not sharing information and payments in 
the most efficient way. Blockchain is such a technology and connecting it with Artificial Intelligence 
is the key to enabling the achievement of (quasi) maximum efficiency in such Mixed Value Chains.

ORS Group has developed the concept of Hypersmart Contracts, i.e. intelligent connectors (smart 
daemons with an associated Ethereum account) which (i) activate A.I. algorithms (off-chain) to 
solve complex efficiency/optimization problems utilizing data stored on-chain by independent, 
decentralized organizations; and (ii) can release instant crypto payments. Thanks to Hypersmart 
Contracts (“HSC”), the power of A.I. can be applied to reach the highest possible level of efficiency 
(and, therefore, of profitability) in the flows of goods/services, information and payments within any 
value chain.

ORS GROUP is a pioneer in this area: for more than twenty years our AI-based software solutions 
have helped Fortune 2000 customers from various fields to automatically optimize trillions of digital 
transactions daily. What makes such achievements possible are so-called Hypersmart Algorithms, 
i.e. combinable modules of sophisticated algorithms. They are the building blocks for more than a 
hundred proprietary software solutions (the “ORS Hypersmart Solutions”) sold to global organiza-
tions (see www.ORS.ai).

Following our aforementioned business and technology trajectory, and harnessing our long experi-
ence providing innovative software solutions, more than a hundred leading algo-scientists and IT 
developers at ORS are currently working on connecting Hypersmart Algorithms with the decentral-
ized information logic of distributed ledgers (aka blockchain) and the use of cryptocurrencies for 
instant payments.

The development of the ORS Platform & Marketplace (open to third parties) for buying and selling 
Algorithms and Hypersmart Contracts will enable both established businesses and new blockchain 
projects from the Crypto Community to dramatically enhance their own business models and gain 
higher profitability and competitive advantage.

Hypersmart Contracts, Algorithms and other digital assets developed by both ORS SA as well as by 
third parties shall be freely tradeable on the Platform & Marketplace through ORS’ own utility token, 
the “ORST”.

1. The premise leading to the merging of A.I. with Blockchain
and the Hypersmart Contracts

Figure 1. Three global trends leading to the adoption of Hypersmart Contracts

The following global trends in business & technology lead to our vision of merging Artificial Intelli-
gence ("A.I.") and Blockchain ("BC"): 

 (a) More and more transactions occur digitally; 

 (b) Blockchain based smart contracts can automatically handle and transfer assets between  
 buyers and sellers, without the need of an external trusted authority;   

 (c) A.I., Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics algorithms, altogether here defined as     
 Hypersmart Algorithms or simply A.I. Algorithms, are increasingly being applied to make  
 transactions very smart and able to deal with complex sets of conditions and constraints, of  
 stochastic nature.

We therefore foresee an imminent future in which most business transactions in any value chain are 
decided and executed by Hypersmart Contracts, a new concept for connecting A.I. Algorithms with 
the decentralized information logic of Blockchain and the release of cryptocurrency payments. At 
ORS SA we are developing a unique Platform & Marketplace (together, the “Platform”), which shall 
allow the selling and purchasing of both proprietary and third parties’ A.I. Algorithms and Hypers-
mart Contracts through the newly issued ORS Token. In addition, business users of Hypersmart Con-
tracts will be enabled to adopt cryptocurrencies within their own value chains to improve overall 
efficiency and to reduce time-to-market.

Our established international customer base, already using hundreds of AI-based software solu-
tions, will facilitate early adoption, fast growth and cash flow positive use of the Hypersmart Con-
tract sold by ORS SA over its Platform.



Finally, modern value chains are highly complex (think of the iPhone suppliers network world-
wide) and require more and more A.I., Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics algorithms (here 
defined as “Hypersmart Algorithms”) for stochastic and dynamic automatic optimization and 
execution of trillions of process-related transactions.

Indeed, transaction instead of contracts is a more appropriate word for describing what an SC is 
supposed to automate in decentralized organizations, as almost all businesses worldwide are 
currently structured. But although supply chains can already be optimally and automatically run 
by algorithms in terms of flow of goods (“what product should be delivered from where, to whom 
and through what routing”), the exchange of information (including documents) and money (pay-
ments) within such supply chains is still sub-optimal due to the lack of trust among participants 
and due to procedural constrains. As a result, the flow of goods is slower than what would be 
possible thanks to Hypersmart Algorithms, which are so to speak “constrained” by the cumber-
someness of the documents and payments cycles. The solution to this issue, which is very likely 
costing trillions every year, is the connection of Hypersmart Algorithms with the Blockchain tech-
nology, creating the new concept of Hypersmart Contracts, i.e. software optimizing and auto-
mating complex business transactions, including the decentralized information/documents 
management and the instant release of cryptocurrency payments by successful execution.

The notion of ‘smart contracts’ became a generic term as a result of the notoriety gained by the Ethe-
reum blockchain and the increased traction on distributed ledger technologies. However, the idea 
has been around for a long time. Nick Szabo, the cryptographer known for his research on digital 
currencies, wrote an article about smart contracts as early as 1996.  Mr. Szabo defined the term 
smart contract as ‘a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the 
parties perform on these promises’.  

In his 1996 article, Szabo predicted that the digital revolution would drastically change the way we 
currently construct contracts. Szabo saw early on that computers were making it possible to run 
algorithms that used to be too costly, and believed algorithms eventually would be developed for 
what he termed ‘smart contracts’. The blockchain-based smart contracts, or self-executing con-
tracts, were developed to automatically and securely execute obligations and release cryptocurrency 
payments on the basis of very simple and rigid set of conditions (like for example, an option agree-
ment with a triggering event or an escrow agreement) and without the need for intermediaries.  
Although several business opportunities arise from the use of the smart contracts, important limita-
tions ought to be carefully taken into consideration.

Firstly, the current implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum platform is not fully secured. 
The consequences of unsafe and short-sighted design choices on the programming languages can 
be fatal for many businesses. We have witnessed this in the unfortunate epilogue of the DAO.  Since 
then, many other vulnerabilities of smart contracts have been reported (N. Atzei, 2017). 

Secondly, in contrast with contracts concluded in form of action, speech or writing, a smart contract 
is ‘just’ a computer program built on code: it is still unclear  whether it can be considered a contract 
from the legal point of view, whether it has parties or it is merely a matter of decentralized computer 
programming (Lauslahti, Mattila, & Seppälä, 2017). In addition, smart contracts are very “‘rigid’ 
because terms & conditions are coded immutably and not subject to real-life variability and construa-
bility – demanding adjustments that only humans can decide upon.



As matter of fact, on November, 06 2017 an unidentified person deleted a smart contract upon which Parity multi-signature wallets’ functionality
relied, causing more than $300 million worth of ether being locked. See: http://read.bi/2hHcDiK (last visited 18 Dec 2017).  Pertinent to mention,
Parity fixed a previous bug in July, which allowed $32 million in Ether to be stolen.

Yet another major issue is that like any other piece of code, a smart contract can be prone to defects. 
However, unlike any other piece of code, a smart contract is not patchable: hence, once it is 
deployed, if it contains a serious defect, the smart contract could be very harmful to any dependent 
system . 

Additional limitation is related to the impossibility, by design, of changing the behavior of a smart 
contract in response to some external event (every change of state on a blockchain must be com-
pletely deterministic): this is in contrast with the fact that modern value chains are highly complex 
(think of the iPhone suppliers network worldwide) and require more and more A.I., Machine Learning 
and Big Data Analytics algorithms (here defined as ‘Hypersmart Algorithms’ or simply A.I. Algo-
rithms) for stochastic and dynamic automatic optimization and execution of trillions of process-re-
lated transactions.

Indeed, ‘transactions’ instead of ‘contracts’ would be a more appropriate term for describing smart 
contracts. Smart contracts are supposed to automate not only decentralized organizations but also 
existing centralized or distributed business models. However, although value chains can already be 
optimally and automatically run by algorithms in terms of flow of goods (“which product should be 
delivered from where, to whom and by what route”), the exchange of information (including docu-
ments) and money (payments) within such value chains is still suboptimal due to the lack of trust 
among independent participants and due to procedural constrains. As a result, the flow of goods is 
slower than what would be possible with A.I. Algorithms, which are so to speak ‘constrained’ by the 
cumbersomeness of the administrative and payments cycles. 

The solution to this issue, which is unnecessary costly is the connection of A.I. Algorithms with 
Blockchain technology, creating the new concept of Hypersmart Contracts. Hypersmart Contracts 
optimize and automate complex business transactions, including the decentralized management of 
information and documents, and the instant release of cryptocurrency payments by successful 
execution.

Hypersmart Contracts (‘HSC’) are ORS SA’s innovative concept of integrating A.I. Algorithms with the 
decentralized storage and the computing power of blockchain contracts (e.g., Ethereum smart con-
tracts or Hyperledger Chain codes) for optimizing business processes (the flow of goods and of 
information/documents) and automatically releasing payments for executing complex transactions 
– for example in supply chains. 

Hypersmart Contracts are smart daemons with an associated Ethereum account and can be consid-
ered a design concept connecting AI-based software (both on cloud hosting and on dedicated serv-
ers) with some key functionalities of Blockchain (smart contracts releasing crypto payments; decen-
tralized document management). In simple terms, by connecting on-chain and off-chain ‘worlds’, 
developers and entrepreneurs – especially from the Crypto Community - can create compelling busi-
ness models and software solutions. HSCs help to optimally decide and automatically steer busi-
ness transactions across value chains and industries (including very innovative B2C business 
models). Hypersmart Contracts can be used to overcome current limitations of smart contracts, as 
explained above in previous section.
The reasons behind such integration of A.I.-based software and Blockchain are as follows:

 A.l. Algorithms are increasingly being adopted for automatic steering and optimizing of com-
plex business processes in real time under stochastic conditions (‘digitalization’; ‘Industry 4.0’; etc.) 
As per the PWC report,  A.I. could contribute up to $15.7 trillion USD to the global economy in 2030, 
more than the current output of China and India combined. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from 
increased productivity and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption side effects.

 Blockchain technologies permit the avoidance of useless (and costly) intermediaries, perfor-
mance of operations in untrusted environments and obtaining certified transactions of data and - 
more generally – of digital assets.

 The use of cryptocurrencies can dramatically shorten payments cycles, allowing immediate 
transfer of money (upon fulfillment of conditions written in smart contracts).

 In an accelerating digital economy, global value chains - which often involve untrusted parties 
– require faster and more optimized flows of goods, of information/data and of payments.

 Existing smart contracts are unsuitable for automatically executing and optimizing complex 
business transactions, as the language only features some basic arithmetic, logical, and crypto oper-
ations (M. Bartoletti, 2017).

From the technological point of view, the ORS Hypersmart Contract is a software program hosted on 
the ORS Platform and with an associated Ethereum account. Upon receipt of a specified amount of 
ORS tokens, the HSC can activate an A.I. algorithms-based software solution to solve complex opti-
mization problems, which are parameterized with information previously stored by third parties on a 
blockchain (different HSC can interact with different blockchain types). The UML  sequence diagram 
in Figure 3 shows more in details the general working mechanism of the Hypersmart Contracts. On 
the left, two different actors are represented: Master and Participants. The Master is an entity (an 
organization, a person, a software system), that needs to solve a complex optimization problem 
(both B2B and B2C); the problem can be solved by a specific ORS’ or certified third party’s AI-based 
software solution (the ‘Hypersmart Solution(s)’) available on the Platform.

To get the problem solved, the first thing the Master ought to do is to describe it following the given 
specification syntax and to write such information on the blockchain (the Hypersmart Contracts are 
blockchain-agnostic, i.e., depending on the business case, different HSC can use different block-
chains). Subsequently, and depending on the business case, other entities – the Participants - (an 
organization, a person, a software system) can in the problem-solving framework by declaring their 
contribution (typically, information such as quantity of goods, effort, etc.) on the same blockchain. It 
is important to notice that both Master and Participants rely on the mining process of the underlying 
blockchain, that guarantees integrity of the data.

Public key cryptography can ensure secrecy and authenticity of communications. After a certain 
amount of time, the Master will activate a specific HSC by transferring a well-defined amount of ORS 
tokens (again, each HSC will make its terms of use publicly available). When the transfer of crypto-
currency occurs, the HSC reads from the blockchain all the data related to that problem-solving 
request and ‘calls’ the relevant Hypersmart Solution available on the Platform. After the computa-
tion, the resulting information is written back on the blockchain and is available to both the Master 
and the Participants. Further steps may involve the same HSC with a different parameterization and 
problem request or may rely on an additional HSC.

By acting as a liaison between the on-chain and the off-chain worlds, Hypersmart Contracts are set 
to deliver major improvements against current limitations of smart contracts and will help to achieve 
the following major benefits for users (both established businesses and innovative blockchain proj-
ects from the Crypto Community): 

 The flexible architecture of the ORS Platform will allow dynamic usage of Big Data (both from  
 businesses ERP systems and from external/public databases).

 Managing properly the stochastic conditions under which almost all B2B and B2C transac 
 tions occur.

 Allowing the fast and powerful computation required by the modern complexity of value  
 chains and by the use of A.I. algorithms.

 Open source and API-based coding shall enable third parties’ certified offering of innovative  
 Hypersmart Contracts and solutions.

 Near-instant value chains (‘productivity/efficiency singularity’).

 De facto elimination of ‘last mile’ inefficiencies in business transactions, due to cumbersome  
 management of information and documents, and slow traditional processing of bookkeeping  
 and payment procedures.

ORS SA has its registered office in Lugano, Switzerland and is one of the sister entities of the ORS 
GROUP software companies (the ‘ORS GROUP’). With over 20 years of software development experi-
ence, ORS GROUP is a pioneer in A.I Algorithms and provides optimization software solutions (a.k.a. 
Hypersmart Solutions), which model the underlying business processes and take decisions in an 
automated manner for Fortune 2000 companies. The solutions cover all the relevant business 
processes of value chains (from production and supply chain, to sales & marketing) across a host of 
industries. While it is not the object of this document to delve into the details of the ORS GROUP 
Hypersmart Solutions, the reader can see them in Figure 4 and obtain additional information from 
the website (https://www.ors.ai/index.php/en/).

With Hypersmart Contracts, over 1,000 proprietary A.I. Algorithms and related software solutions, 
all easily pluggable, are made available to developers and entrepreneurs worldwide, especially from 
the Blockchain/Crypto Community. Such a modular software ecosystem, which is the core of the 
ORS GROUP platform (the ‘RAMS 4.0’ Platform)  , will constitute the base of the ORS SA Platform for 
Hypersmart Contracts, A.I. Algorithms and solutions and other digital assets. Figure 5  shows a 
high-level view of the current RAMS 4.0 architecture.

Starting from the bottom, we observe that several data acquisition modules have been developed, 
which allow the extraction of petabytes of data from heterogeneous sources: ERP systems, legacy 
frameworks, open data portals and streams, social networks; currently, more than 50 different 
API-plugins have been developed to connect with several data sources and feed a data lake based 
on Hadoop technology. Following the figure towards the top, the data are extracted – dynamically 
and on demand - from the data lake and organized on multi-dimensional structures, called cubes. 
The cubes are the data structures from which the ORS Hypersmart Contracts and Solutions will 
retrieve data (in the figure are represented only a few of them, which are all web-based applications).

5.1The Marketplace

Figure 6 contains a logical view of the same architecture: it shows how the RAMS 4.0 Platform 
‘looks’ at businesses/value chains like a set of assets (logistics, production, customers, etc.) with 
associated performances and risks. Increasing performance and reducing risks require optimiza-
tion, which the RAMS 4.0 platform achieves through cutting-edge scientific libraries of algorithms. 

The ORS Utility Token (the ‘ORST’) is an Ethereum based token compliant with the ERC 20 standard 
(see Section 6.5 for token details). The ORST is used for buying and selling Hypersmart Contracts, 
A.I. Algorithms and Solutions and other digital assets (together, the ‘Platform Services’) on the ORS 
SA Platform & Marketplace (the ‘Platform’) and to activate such Platform Services (both ORS’ ones 
and certified third parties’ ones). 

The marketplace is the part of the Platform for buying and selling the Platform Services (Hypersmart 
Contracts, A.I. Algorithms and Solutions and other digital assets), while the platform component is 
the ORS SA’s open (to third parties) and HSC-based version of the RAMS 4.0 architecture created by 
ORS GROUP. The first Hypersmart Contracts will be created and published by ORS SA, thanks to the 
vast library of A.I. Algorithms existing at ORS GROUP, so that established businesses and new 
blockchain projects can immediately take advantage of all the already existing algorithms and relat-
ed software solutions. At operating speed, the Platform will also host third-parties’ certified HSC and 
A.I. Algorithms: the certification process by ORS SA will ensure that the minimum level of quality is 
matched, predominantly - but not solely - on security and reliability. The Platform is designed to host 
not merely Hypersmart Contracts, but in addition a wider range of digital assets, such as: 



 Algorithms & related Software Solutions will be hosted on special virtual machines, created  
 on demand, and scalable, to solve specific optimization problems. Since data is ‘raw’ and  
 algorithms work on conventional exposed data, tools for declaring the shape of the original  
 data source and transform them as needed by the algorithms are needed and tradable too.
 
 Data: ORS GROUP already handles a huge amount of proprietary and public business data in  
 ‘raw’ form. Portions of such data can be exposed to the market, so that customers can buy  
 and import such portions in their own data lake (with provided ETL functions). It will also be  
 possible to register external data sources and the streams to collect such data: streams
 move and convert data to the data lakes of customers, who could use or even trade the data  
 on the market place.

In addition to algorithms and access to data, the Platform shall offer a variety of data services, start-
ing from: 

 ISO-compliant data quality and cleansing: in the Big Data world, quality of data is of extreme  
 importance. The ISO/IEC standards on software data quality modelling (ISO/IEC 25012) and  
 measurement  (ISO/IEC 25024) define 15 quality characteristics and 63 metrics to measure  
 them. The ORS GROUP, contributor to the technical commission  that steered the work on the  
 ISO standards on data quality, will offer through the Platform a service to check datasets  
 against those ISO quality dimensions that are sensitive to the customers business cases. 

 Business Intelligence (‘BI’) Dashboards and Reporting: all existing Hypersmart Solutions  
 include a BI dashboard designed with state of the art User Experience methodologies, which  
 allow easy access to and provide a quick, holistic view of all Key Performance Indicators
  (‘KPI’) (see some examples in Figure 7). The panel is dynamic: pivot graphs, counters, grids,  
 alerts, can be added on the fly to the visualization panel. Furthermore, KPIs can be custom 
 ized by composition of basic metrics, and multidimensional data structures are created with  
 zero latency. Dashboards permit the analysis of the demand (know what you are required to  
 do), resources (know what your capabilities are), to model and decide (drive your decision  
 model for taking optimal options) and be alerted to anomalies in the data.

A reverse auction (also known as a procurement auction) is a process where a producer (the Master) 
seeks new suppliers (the Participants) through a dynamic bidding process. The general procedure is 
the following one: 

 A request for proposal (RFP) is issued (usually via a market maker or on the buyer’s website) 
on the reverse auction site, for a group of products or services. The RFP is open for a specific time, 
depending on the buyer’s needs and on the type of products/services.

 Interested suppliers contact the market maker (or visit the buyer’s website) and place their 
offers (quantities, prices, delivery times, etc.).

 The buyer then awards the supply contract(s) to the winning bidder(s).

A reverse auction mechanism is useful because it normally reduces the price of the goods/services 
to be purchased. There is an on-going competition among suppliers for securing tenders which 
pushes the suppliers to submit compelling offers and maximize their winning probability. However, 
from the perspective of the offeror issuing the tender request, choosing the cheapest bid is not 
equivalent to making the best possible choice as a whole. Multi-facet parameters ought to be con-
sidered: for example, the quality of the bidder services (declared, inferred or measured), all other rele-
vant terms and conditions of the offer, the capacity constraints of the suppliers, the risk of non-fulfill-
ment or of delayed delivery, etc.

These criteria need to be considered to avoid or at least reduce ‘hidden costs’: wrong planning deci-
sions, inefficiencies in production and in other processes of the buyer’s value chain, sale losses, 
lower customer retention and many others. Including all such complex criteria for making an optimal 
choice in a reverse auction process is not an easy task: given the tremendously high complexity of 
modern business, it is common to have to compute thousands of variables as well as several con-
flicting goals and constraints.

To solve such a problem, it is necessary to use big data optimization techniques and algorithms that 
leverage on the latest findings in artificial intelligence and related fields. For example, a current ORS 
GROUP Hypersmart Solution optimally generates the distribution plans throughout a complex 
supply chain network by solving hundreds of thousands of optimization problems (each entailing up 
to 100 million variables) in seconds. The availability of Blockchain technologies adds now the possi-
bility of automatic execution of such Hypersmart Solution in a decentralized and untrusted envi-
ronment, both in domestic and cross-border trades, eliminating the related paperwork and bureau-
cracy.

The UML sequence diagram in Figure 9 depicts how Hypersmart Contracts can be used in the supply 
chain reverse auction. The process represented in the figure is a specialization of the general use 
case illustrated in Figure 3: the Master is the buyer that sends to the distributed ledger the request 
for bids, thus initiating the reverse auction process (in the diagram we imagined a retail company, 
however it can be applied to many other sectors). The request is uniquely identifiable through a label. 
Potential suppliers (the Participants) monitor the ledger, and when a new request appears, if interest-
ed, they can respond by sending their offer to the same distributed ledger: the format of the request 
and the necessary parameters are specified upfront, while public key encryption offers a solid mech-
anism for ensuring confidentiality. The blockchain mining process guarantees integrity of the infor-
mation provided by both Master and Participants. As in the traditional auction process, after a speci-
fied amount of time, the Master needs to check the offers and to opt for the best (i.e. optimized) 
solution: here is where the Hypersmart Contracts play a role.

When the set time expires, all the Master has to do is to execute a payment transaction of n  ORST 
to the specific Hypersmart Contract handling the reverse auction process.  Upon the reception of 
the payment in ORST (that occurs real time also in case of trans-continental payments, differently 
from traditional payment systems), the HSC will retrieve the information related to that specific 
request from the Blockchain and pass them to the off-chain Hypersmart Solution containing the 
dedicated algorithms for solving the optimization problem; the result of the complex bidding optimi-
zation problem is then written back on the ledger: as for the general HSC behavior, sensitive infor-
mation on the blockchain is encrypted and accessible only for the HSC and Master via the standard 
public-key infrastructure. The following steps can involve again the same HSC (differently parame-
terized) and/or other ones.

The use of Hypersmart Contracts in reverse auctions provides several benefits, both for buyers and 
sellers. Firstly, using the Blockchain as an information layer permits a much broader set of suppliers 
to participate in the proposal (no pre-selection of vendors is needed): the expected result is a more 
dynamic competition and lower prices. Secondly, the HSC permits a fully automated auction, saving 
a relevant amount of time in the final selection process. Lastly, the format of the proposals sent to 
the Blockchain and gathered by the HSC allows not only an easier and instantaneous direct compari-
son, but also to specify through parameters a large set of business constraints and to select the 
bidder(s) through optimization: as a matter of fact, the current ORS Hypersmart Solutions named 
RAISE  automatically solves in less than 30 minutes over 80,000 network flow problems, some of 
which have >100M variables (achieving for a large international manufacturing and retail company 
the following results:  -50% in inventories, -25% back orders, -50% goods movements, near to zero out 
of stock; all together accounting for € 150M in yearly savings).

6.2 Use Case 2- Demand planning

Figure 10. The consequences of information asymmetries 
along complex value chains

Demand planning is affected by a notorious problem: forecast inaccuracies cost billions every year 
to almost all complex value chains, mostly due to information asymmetries among the participants 
(see Figure 10). At ORS GROUP, we are already solving this problem with Hypersmart Solutions that 
produce and harmonize independent forecasts at different hierarchies. The demand planning HSC 
shall link the Blockchain-based collaborative information sharing possibility to the off-chain artifi-
cial intelligence of Hypersmart Solutions, creating a fast collaborative, consensus-based forecast 
process aiming at improving forecast accuracy for all participants throughout the chain. Participa-
tion is fostered by the issuance of crypto-rewards to participants sharing both valuable and accurate 
information (the verification is automatically performed by specific HSC). Public key cryptography 
ensures that information is visible only to the HSC. Figure 11 shows how the process works: 

 Information sharing for collaborative  
 demand and supply planning is   
 obtained through the Blockchain
 Cryptocurrency payments are to be  
 released as a reward for information  
 (including estimates) sharing, accu 
 racy and utility
 A.I. Algorithms compute the fore  
 casts, automatically exchange data  
 with ERP systems, discover informa 
 tion incongruencies and inconsisten 
 cies and in general reduce forecast  
 errors and therefore save money to  
 all participants of the value chain
 The Hypersmart Contract ‘buys’ the  
 computational services of the algo 
 rithms and delivers both the results  
 as well as it releases crypto reward  
 payments to some participants

The first reward (participation reward) is given to all the participants willing to share proprietary 
information, since their data is valuable for improving demand and supply forecast accuracy. The 
second reward is given if certain (computed) information quality and utility criteria are met.

6.3 Use Case 3- The Buy Anything Get Anywhere (BAGA™) use case with
permissioned blockchain 

Optimal store inventory sizing is a well-known issue in the retail & fashion business: the dilemma of 
stocking the right mix and quantity of products, including customized Stock Keeping Units (SKU, a 
product and service identification code for a store or product), is non-trivial. When customers visit 
either the online sale channel or the brick-and-mortar stores and they don’t find the goods they 
would like to buy, two major problems occur: (i) Loss of revenues (ii) Customer retention and cus-
tomer satisfaction are likely lowered. Excess inventories would be the easiest countermeasure, how-
ever this dramatically reduces profitability. 

The BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution solves this problem by optimally balancing out multiple variables 
and constraints to ensure fulfilment while maximizing margins. Whenever a customer wishes to 
buy an item not immediately available at her channel of choice (store or online shop), BAGA™ finds 
that item at nearby stores or distribution centers and automatically initiates order fulfilment to 
reduce ‘lost sales’. Using BAGA™, retailers are able to rapidly serve customer requests while ensuring 
all the operational and financial constraints are met and thus optimize profitability. BAGA™ uses a 
complex non-linear optimization function which is unique for every single item requested by cus-
tomers. The A.I. Algorithms solving the problem are executed in a scalable software environment, 
ensuring real-time response.

Figure 14 shows how the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution is activated by a corresponding Hypersmart 
Contract, which uses a permissioned blockchain as a shared (and decentralized) information layer. 
The first step in the UML sequence diagram is the setting of constraints: using a very intuitive user 
interface, managers can easily set up various business constraints. A few examples of constraints 
that can be set up through the User Interface are: 

 Distribution center (DC) vs store priority: if for a certain requesting store “A” this constraint is  
 set to “DC”, then the most convenient Distribution Center (DC) will be chosen even if picking  
 from another store in the network would be better. This might be necessary, for example, to  
 accelerate DC clearing before the new collections are stocked.

 Quarantine of new products: Excluding new products - for a certain amount of time - might be  
 useful to observe the new products sales trends.

 Stores to be excluded: Top sales stores with high product volatility may justify the need to  
 exclude a store from the fulfilment network. 

The constraints are specified via graphical interface and then sent to the blockchain as pairs of 
keys-values. Please notice that the information stored in the blockchain includes also inventory 
quantities for each item and location: such a task is easily automatized and permits the riddance of 
centralized inventory systems. For the sake of simplicity, in Figure 14 inventory setting is not repre-
sented, while the setting of business constraints is placed at the beginning of the use case: however, 
the reader should keep in mind that they are modifiable at any moment by the users (Figure 12 
shows that no technical knowledge is involved for defining business constraints through the dash-
board commands).

Figure 12. Setting up business constraints in BAGA

Figure 13.  BAGA BI dashboard is configurable through plug and play addons

The second step in the diagram is the item request made by a shop clerk when a customer needs a product 
with speci�c characteristics (e.g., a certain combination of size and color) that is not available at the shop. 
The request is raised via graphical interface, and initiates the BAGA™-Hypersmart Contract, after the auto-
matic payment of a speci�ed amount of ORST. Once activated, the BAGA™-HSC will notify all the partici-
pants of the network (i.e., distribution centers and shops) about the item requested: this is done by putting 
such information on the blockchain, while a program on the DCs/shops frontend monitors that blockchain. 
The request usually must be satis�ed in real time, however there are also cases in which such requirement 
is not necessary: the diagram encompasses both cases.

In the �rst option (real time answer), when an item request is received by the BAGA™-HSC, the BAGA™ 
Hypersmart Solution on the Platform is immediately activated: the constraints (regardless of their number) 
are retrieved by the BAGA™-HSC from the blockchain, passed to the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution and 
checked to determine whether the request is satis�able; in positive case, a �rst list of eligible locations is 
created. Then the list is further reduced by excluding the locations not having enough stock (also consider-
ing the minimum stock threshold, if applicable). Once the new list of eligible source locations is de�ned, 
the most convenient location is selected from an expected net profitability perspective.

Figure 14. The BAGA Hypersmart contract

It is worthwhile mentioning that the optimization made by the BAGA™ A.I. Algorithms takes also into 
account the expected daily sales, inferred by analyzing the log (on the blockchain) of historical oper-
ations, with very high granularity: daily expected sales are calculated for each store, class and type, 
for each month. The forecast engine is programmed with Smart Strategies to adapt to the different 
contexts; for example, adjustment towards previous seasons is automatically made: if new predic-
tions are significantly higher (or lower) than previous season results, all the predictions are reduced 
(or respectively increased).

26

The inclusion of the expected daily sales does not prevent BAGA™ finding the optimal solution in 
real-time. 
The second option represents situations in which a real-time answer is not necessary. Imagine, for 
example, a business customer who wants to change in the next three months all the uniforms in her 
company: she chooses items in several combinations, and not all of them are available in that 
moment at the shop. In such a situation, the BAGA™-HSC can work in a slightly different way. The 
steps in the optional boxes of Figure 14 of the diagram refer to this case: after the request is received 
by the BAGA™-HSC and all the participants are notified by monitoring the blockchain, there is a time 
window in which the participants can proactively offer to provide the items requested by specifying 
delivery time and additional parameters.

This is done by sending the offer to the distributed ledger. At the elapse of the time window, the 
BAGA™-HSC retrieves the offers from the blockchain. The offers collected will be included (and, 
potentially, prioritized) by the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution. If one (or more) offer is selected as an 
acceptable solution, the participant will be rewarded with a certain amount of ORST. In both urgent 
and not-urgent requests, the selected participant receives the order to ship the item, while all notifi-
cations (including inventory updates) are sent to the blockchain.

The use of the ORS HSC in conjunction with the blockchain fosters higher participation between 
shops/distribution centers, with respect to the current BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution; it also provides 
additional data to improve the precision of the BAGA™ A.I. Algorithms with more detailed and updat-
ed information on the demand curve, retrievable from the blockchain. An additional and remarkable 
advantage of using the BAGA™-HSC in combination with the distribution ledger, is the possibility for 
independent third parties -such as franchise companies- to participate in the SKU provision call 
with their offer: in fact, the blockchain guarantees data certification even in an untrusted environ-
ment, while the off-chain intelligence of HSC ensures optimal profitability and service level.

We conclude remarking that the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution includes a BI dashboard, designed with 
state of the art User Experience methodologies, which allows to get a quick, holistic view of all KPIs 
(see Figure 13). The panel is dynamic: pivot graphs, counters, grids, alerts, can be added on the fly to 
the visualization panel. Furthermore, KPIs can be customized by composing basic metrics, and mul-
tidimensional data structures are created with zero latency.

6.4 Blockchain types 

6.5 The ORS Token 

Hypersmart Contracts are blockchain agnostic: each business case requires a careful analysis of 
which blockchain infrastructure and typology (e.g., permissions, consensus mechanism) should be 
used as an information layer. The reason lies in the fact that Hypersmart Solutions cover a very wide 
range of application fields (energy, finance, retail, industry 4.0, logistics, etc. ) and domain require-
ments are so disparate that no unique silver bullet works for all of them. Initial reference points are 
Ethereum (Buterin, 2014) for the permission-less blockchains and Hyperledger Fabric (Cachin, 2016) 
for permissioned ones. Further blockchain solutions might be considered on a case by case logic, 
including experimental developments - such as the Lightning Network (Poon & Dryja, 2016) that 
proposes off-chain transactions  to overcome the blockchain scalability issues (Conoscenti, Vetrò, & 
De Martin, 2017).

The ORS Utility Token (the ‘ORST’) is an Ethereum based token compliant with the ERC20 standard. 
It is the means of transacting within the ORS Platform. ORS decided to use its own native token 
instead of using an already existing cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Ether, etc.) to 
create a specific marketplace for HSC and for all other Platform Services to be offered to established 
businesses and to the Crypto Community. The use of Ethereum as the coin backbone allows a scal-
able transaction infrastructure with international access: the Platform is designed to foster smooth 
micro transactions for buying modular, computationally complex services (the HSC and the related 
A.I. Algorithms and Solutions, etc. ).  The use of a native token will incentivize companies and the 
Crypto Community to join the Platform for both buying and selling the Services and will also help 
developers and scientists worldwide to monetize their talent and knowledge. In addition, the ORS 
Utility Token will be used as a reward and complement to remuneration for developers and affiliates, 
in order to engage them and improve their commitment towards the project. With such characteris-
tics, the ORST can attract several typologies of buyers: 

 Established Businesses: Buying A.I.-based HSC for optimizing all flows (goods/services;  
 information; payments) of key processes of their value chains

 Developers and scientists: buying and using HSC, A.I. Algorithms and Solutions, etc. to devel 
 op high competitive business models; selling and monetizing own HSC and algorithms

 Innovators in Blockchain/Ethereum projects: Buying the Platform Services for differentiating   
 own blockchain / Ethereum projects; selling innovative projects to Fortune 2000 already  
  served by the ORS GROUP

The ORST does not have the legal qualification as a security, since it does not give any rights on 
dividends or interest. The ORST is final and non-refundable. The ORST is not a share and does not 
give any right to participate in the general meetings of the Company. The ORST cannot have a perfor-
mance or a particular value outside the ORS Platform.
After the ORST are used the first time to buy products and services offered on the ORS Platform, part 
of the ORST will be gradually reintroduced to the market, in order to sustain the liquidity of the 
tokens.

Off chain transactions represent one of the main solutions proposed to the well-known blockchain scalability problem, especially relevant in
data-intensive applications (Conoscenti, Vetrò, & De Martin, 2017)

7. Development and business roadmap
The development of the ORS Hypersmart Contracts, which include the corresponding A.I. Algorithms 
and/or Solutions, and the development of the Platform will follow an iterative-incremental process, 
with the significant advantage that the starting point is the existing and running ORS GROUP RAMS 
4.0 platform as well as over 1,000 A.I. Algorithms and over 100 software solutions for optimizing 
value chains. The planned roadmap is represented in Figure 15 . The initial development (Phase 1) 
step will produce the first Hypersmart Contracts and base functionalities of the marketplace and of 
the Platform. From the Phase 2, third-parties’ HSC, algorithms and solutions will be allowed to be 
hosted (upon successful certification process by ORS ), while the development of the Platform will 
proceed until its final release in Q1 of 2019 at the latest. 

The long experience at ORS GROUP in developing sophisticated software solutions, including plat-
forms, and delivering them on time to demanding international customers is the best guarantee that 
the development and business roadmap of the ORS SA Platform for Hypersmart Contracts will be 
duly and professionally executed, achieving all set goals.

11. The ORST, Legal, and Token Sale (Crowdsale)
Legal & Regulatory Opinion

General Information

The ORST does not have the legal qualification of a security, since it does not give any rights to 
dividends or interests. The sale of ORST is final and non-refundable. ORST are not shares and do not 
give any right to participate to the general meeting of ORS SA. ORST cannot have a performance or 
a value outside the ORS Marketplace and Platform. ORST shall therefore not be used or purchased 
for speculative or investment purposes. The purchaser of ORST is aware that national securities 
laws, which ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are 
subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection, are not applicable.
Anyone purchasing ORST expressly acknowledges and represents that she/he has carefully 
reviewed this white paper and fully understands the risks, costs and benefits associated with the 
purchase of ORST.

Knowledge required

The purchaser of ORST undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of cryp-
tocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks associat-
ed with crowdsales as well as the mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies (incl. storage).
ORS SA shall not be responsible for any loss of ORST or situations making it impossible to access 
the Tokens, which may result from any actions or omissions of the user or any person undertaking 
to acquire ORST, as well as in case of hacker attacks.

Risks

Acquiring ORST and storing them involves various risks, in particular the risk that ORS SA may not be 
able to launch its operations and develop its blockchain and provide the services promised. There-
fore, and prior to acquiring ORST, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of 
acquiring ORST in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, obtain any independent advice in 
this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept or to understand the risks 
associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development of the ORS Platform) or 
any other risks as indicated in the Terms & Conditions of the crowdsale should not acquire any ORST.

Important disclaimer

This white paper shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into an investment. It 
does not constitute or relate in any way nor should be considered as an offering of securities in any 
jurisdiction. The white paper does not include nor contain any information or indication that might be 
considered as a recommendation or that might be used as a basis for any investment decision. This 
document does not constitute an offer or an invitation to sell shares, securities or rights belonging 
to ORS SA or any related or associated company. The ORST is just a utility token which can be used 
only on the ORS Marketplace and Platform and is not intended to be used as an investment.

ORS SA Whitepaper

The offering of ORST on a trading platform is done in order to allow the use of the ORS Marketplace 
and Platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of ORST on a trading platform is not 
changing the legal qualification of the Token, which remains a simple means for the use of the ORS
Marketplace and Platform and is not a security.

ORS SA is not to be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial matters. Any information in 
the white paper is given for general information purpose only and ORS SA does not provide with any 
warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of this information. Given the lack of crypto-token 
qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis 
concerning the purchase and ownership of ORST according to their nationality and place of resi-
dence.

ORS SA today is not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law and is not required to obtain any 
authorization for Anti-Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change in case ORS SA will 
offers services which are to be considered as qualified financial intermediation activity. In this case, 
the use of the ORS services may require the positive conclusion of a AML/KYC identification 
process. 

ORST confer no direct or indirect right to ORS SA’s capital or income, nor does it confer any gover-
nance right within ORS SA; an ORST is not proof of ownership or a right of control over ORS SA and 
does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in ORS SA, or in the ORS Marketplace and 
Platform. An ORST does not grant any right to participate in control over ORS SA’s management or 
decision-making set-up, or over the ORS Marketplace and Platform and governance to the purchas-
ers of the Tokens.

Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to cryptocur-
rencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact ORS 
SA’s business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the future. Any person 
undertaking to acquire ORST must be aware of the ORS SA business model, the white paper or terms 
and conditions may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance 
requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such a case, purchasers and anyone 
undertaking to acquire ORST acknowledge and understand that neither ORS SA nor any of its affili-
ates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused by such changes.

ORS SA will do its utmost to launch its operations and develop the HSCs and the ORS Marketplace 
and Platform. Anyone undertaking to acquire ORST acknowledges and understands that ORS SA 
does not provide any guarantee that it will manage to achieve it. At the conclusion of the token sale, 
the ORST shall be issued and delivered to the Contributors by means of a technical process as a 
Ethereum Smart Contract. This is an open source IT protocol over which ORS SA has no rights or 
liability in terms of its development and operations. The Token distribution mechanism will be con-
trolled by a smart contract; this involves a computer program that can be executed on the Ethereum 
network or on a blockchain network that is compatible with smart contract programming language. 
Purchasers of ORST therefore acknowledge and understand that ORS SA (incl. its government 
bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would 
result from or relate to the incapacity to use ORST, except in case of intentional misconduct or gross 
negligence.

ORST is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or unex-
pected operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the ORS Marketplace and Platform, and/or the 
ORST, and/or any other operation at ORS SA to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected. 
Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit may itself lose value in a similar way to ORST, and 
also in other ways.

Governing law – Arbitration

The Purchasers acknowledge and accept that the ORS SA’s Token Sale is taking place within a Swiss 
legal environment that is still under development. The Purchasers and ORS SA agree to seek an ami-
cable settlement prior to bringing any legal action. All disputes arising with regard to this with paper 
shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the 
Swiss Chambers of Commerce in force on the date when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted in 
accordance with these Rules. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only. The seat of 
the arbitration shall be Lugano, Switzerland.

The arbitral proceedings shall be conducted in English. ORST will not be listed on any regulated stock 
exchange, such as SIX Swiss Exchange, or SIX. These Terms have been prepared without regard to 
the legal standards for prospectuses under art. 1156 or art. 652a of the Swiss Code of Obligations 
or the legal standards for facilitated prospectuses under art. 5 of the Collective Investment Schemes 
Act (“CISA”) or art. 27 ff. of the SIX Listing Rules or the listing rules of any other stock exchange in 
Switzerland. Neither these terms nor any other material relating to the Token Sale, ORS SA or ORST 
will be or have been filed with or approved by any Swiss regulatory authority. Specifically, these terms 
will not be filed with, and the Token Sale of ORST will not be supervised by the Swiss Financial Market 
Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). Furthermore, the sale of ORST has not been and will not be 
authorized under the CISA. Thus, the protection which is given to purchasers of interests or units in 
collective investment schemes under the CISA does not extend to purchasers of ORST.
