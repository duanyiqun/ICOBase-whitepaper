A TRANSPARENT SPORTS BETTING AND GAMBLING PLATFORM BASED ON SMART 

CONTRACTS ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN THAT RETURNS 100% OF PROFITS TO 

THE DBET HOUSE CREDIT HOLDERS. 

 

VERSION 0.5.2 

 

ABSTRACT 

 
 

Decent.bet is a transparent, smart contract based sports betting platform and 

online casino.  Employing the Ethereum blockchain based smart contracts, 

Decent.bet is aiming for mass adoption. Unlike other decentralized gambling 

platforms which primarily use Ether and Bitcoin for transactions, Decent.bet 

makes use of specialized ERC20 tokens – DBETs to facilitate bets on the platform 

as well as buy credits in the house, known as DBET house credits.  This opens up 

numerous possibilities such as community owned houses, white label solutions and 

more. 

 

The Decent.bet sports betting platform will make use of a trusted setup wherein 

the Decent.bet addresses will provide betting lines and outcomes. All transactions 

will be transparent and verifiable on the blockchain. This transparency will make 

it impossible for malicious or predatory activity to take place from the outset. All 

payouts, credit distributions, lottery winnings, house buy-ins, would be completely 

decentralized and determined on-chain. 

 

A whole host of gambling based casino games will also be available on the 

Decent.bet platform – making use of off-chain state channels that are finally 

verifiable on-chain. The speed and scalability would combine the user experience 

of a high-end gambling platform while bringing the transparency and auditability 

of the blockchain. 

 

This paper discusses the functioning of the Decent.bet user-owned house model, 

state channel based casino games, white label solutions, decentralized houses and 

business prospects for the platform.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

 

2.1 About Decent.bet 

 

Decent.bet is a transparent profit sharing sportsbook and gambling platform employing 

decentralized Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  

 

Decent.bet aims to provide a long-term solution to allow users from around the world 

to establish credit in the houses, DBET house credits, that provide sports betting and 

gambling games while leveraging the blockchain to provide transparency, verifiability 

and constant uptime, unlike other regular online casinos. This platform structure allows 

users to generate returns with minimal interaction while allowing houses on the 

Decent.bet platform to operate and payout DBET house credit returns in a transparent 

and honest manner. 

 

Decent.bet will start out with a single house operated by the Decent.bet platform and 

in due time open doors to traditional casino operators to establish houses on the 

platform. This essentially allows traditional casino operators to leverage blockchain 

technology to provide the next generation of gambling games and sports betting to their 

existing user base. 

 

2.2 Problems and Solutions 

 
 

Problem: High profit-generating gambling platforms owned by a single group/entity 

with limited transparency running on dated technology stacks. 

 

Traditional online casinos/sports betting platforms available in the current market, work 

in a completely centralized manner and operating profits are distributed between 

selected individual(s)/group(s).  

 

Although this may not pose as much of a problem at the moment, with the coming shift 

from centralization and tightly controlled models to a decentralized future, the current 

model has a high-risk of being outdated in the coming years. Decent.bet’s vision aims 



Page 5 of 29                                   
 

to make full use of the opportunity that presents itself with the upcoming shift to 

decentralization – where DBET house credit holders will have a say in how the platform 

moves forward with a decentralized governance model, receive profits generated by 

the platform for each session and even get to contribute to democratically selected 

charitable causes. 

 

With the current push for disruptive blockchain based solutions among all industries 

and the obvious fit for gambling based solutions, there are a few platforms that have 

been conceptualized and at times have even been implemented over the last year. 

However, regardless of what stage existing platforms are at this point in time, there are 

a few fundamental issues that do exist with a majority of them. 

 

Problem: Blockchain based casinos providing slow, costly blockchain dependent 

games without layer-2 solutions, sports betting platforms in their infancy/concept 

stages and profit sharing gambling platforms with a single house model. 

 

Platforms that have been built on the Ethereum Blockchain face the same problems 

that all decentralized platforms built on Ethereum face right now.  Games that are 

traditionally played at a quick pace, are slowed down due to the slow block times for 

RNG and transactions on the blockchain in general. Although this would not be a 

problem in the future with the scheduled upgrades to the Ethereum network that will 

greatly improve its capacity, games right now are painfully slow and don’t replicate any 

regular online casino in terms of speed and experience. This poses a significant 

roadblock in convincing the masses to switch to a blockchain based platform. 

 

Decent.bet being based on Ethereum blockchain faces the same problem at the 

moment as these platforms, but it looks to tackle it by using off-chain state channels 

for RNG and game moves after channel creation. This greatly improves the speed of 

games and offers the experience of any other high-end online casino to the end-user 

while being finally verifiable on-chain. State channels also lead to greatly reduced gas 

costs since transactions do not happen on-chain. 

 

Sports betting platforms on the other hand, pose a different problem in achieving 



Page 6 of 29                                   
 

consensus on events. The task although seemingly straightforward, turns out to be a 

complex action to implement whilst keeping methods of gaming the system to a low 

and reducing malicious entities from pushing the wrong outcomes to the network.  

 

Keeping a 50% majority consensus could lead a single entity/group to simply purchase 

50% of tokens in the network and push the wrong results.  

 

Increasing the consensus requirement, to say 75%, could lead malicious parties to 

constantly hold 26% or more of tokens in the network and push incorrect outcomes 

making it impossible to reach a 75% consensus.  

 

The decentralized crowdsourced outcome reporting problem is definitely a hard one to 

tackle and one which currently has two platforms actively working on solving it– Augur 

and Gnosis. They still have ways to go before being ready for use at this point in time. 

However, in the future APIs provided by the two platforms would be a great resource 

for betting platforms to link with, and provide accurate outcomes in, a decentralized 

manner.  

 

For now, Decent.bet looks to tackle this overarching issue by providing centralized 

oracles for each house on the platform. The blockchain helps provide the transparency 

and verifiability to make sure the houses do not try to cheat players by pushing incorrect 

results to the platform. With multiple houses that spring up on the platform, users would 

have a variety of different outcome and line providers to choose from. This also opens 

doors to bringing in traditional sports betting platforms to adopt the technology provided 

by the Decent.bet platform and in turn increase the platform's user base as a whole. 

 

Apart from the two problems mentioned above, platforms that do have profit sharing 

models at the moment seem to offer it in a closed manner – with a single house splitting 

profits of their offered games among users holding a dividend sharing token. This may 

not be a problem in itself, however for long term expansion of a platform, Decent.bet 

looks to bring in the multiple house model with white labelled houses which will allow 

for providers/casino operators to start their own house and have their own profit-sharing 

mechanisms.

Decent.bet allows users to buy DBET house credits which will allow them to collect 

session returns and participate in the success of the platform in a very unique and 

advantageous manner. Initially, the sportsbook will make use of lines and outcomes 

supplied by addresses owned by Decent.bet.  

 

 

The ERC-20 standard token provided by Decent.bet will be used for all purposes within 

the platform, unlike other smart contract based gambling platforms that allow bets in 

Ether. 

 
 

2.3 Market Analysis 

 
 

Since the majority of the running block chain based gambling platforms have been 

implemented only within the last year, there aren’t any data sources providing usage 

statistics of the emerging market as of yet. However, statistics for online casinos are 

available and would portray an acceptable representation of our target audience and 

future growth potential. 

 

(Ref #4) The market for online casinos as a whole was $35.97 billion USD in 2014 and 

is estimated to reach $66.59 billion USD by 2020, at a CAGR of 10.81%.Additionally, 

the use of mobile devices for online gambling purposes is increasing with market 

growth for this industry being very geographically specific. 

 

More than 80 nations have legalized online gambling and Europe has the largest online 

gambling market in the world which accounts for some 47% of the entire world. 

(http://www.egba.eu/facts-and-figures/market-reality) Importantly, this is something 

which is just going to increase, as countries like the Netherlands adopt new online 

gambling regulations which facilitate and promote growth. Additionally, in the Asia 

Pacific region, the online gambling sector has not grown much, as there has been no 

scope, a fact which promotes both a disadvantage and a significant opportunity to be 

explored. 

http://www.egba.eu/facts-and-figures/market-reality


Page 8 of 29                                   
 

 

Since the online gambling market allows players to use virtual money, it has reduced 

the burden and risk of carrying cash as in the case of real gambling activities, and since 

this can be done in the comfort of one’s home, many people are now resorting to online 

gambling. Something which highlights that there is greater and greater opportunity for 

this market to grow and expand in the near future as governments move to regulate 

practices and enable safe, healthy growth in a market which is still in its infancy. 

 

 

2.4 Limitations 

 
 
 

Obtaining correct and verifiable results/outcomes for sporting events in a completely 

decentralized system would require a significantly larger engineering effort, while also 

opening doors up to a number of security and integrity concerns. 

 

Getting to market early maximizes our potential to succeed, but requires us to use 

authorized addresses to provide outcomes to the contract – which would bring an 

aspect of centralization to the platform. This approach means users would have to rely 

on Decent.bet to provide accurate outcomes for games, all other aspects of sports 

betting – i.e. payouts, bets created, house hedges etc. are all decentralized, 

transparent and verifiable – which is a large improvement over existing centralized 

online gambling platforms operating today. 

 

For gambling games like slots, craps and roulette that rely on instant results and game 

moves to meet the user experience expectations while making sure outcomes are 

verifiable on the blockchain, Decent.bet makes use of state channels between the 

house and users utilizing a REST API to communicate between the user and the house.  

Current competitive implementations rely on an oracle to act as an RNG to call back 

results into a contract, taking much too long in terms of user experience, which 

consequently will decrease the possibility of achieving mass adoption. By using state 

channels that work completely off-chain and are finally verifiable on-chain – we are able 

to sidestep this limitation and improve the timeliness and quality of the service. 



Page 9 of 29                                   
 

 

 

However, with the planned updates to the Ethereum blockchain such as sharding, 

which would increase Ethereum’s capacity in terms of transactions per second – 

Decent.bet will eventually restructure all gambling game contracts to work based on 

completely on-chain solutions.

3.0 DBETS 

 

Decent.bet uses its own ERC-20 standard token, DBETs - for all transactions on the 

platform. Unlike other platforms in the space that make use of Ether and Bitcoin for 

gambling, DBETs are used for gambling along with other use cases such as purchasing 

DBET house credits, buying out custom houses, purchasing lottery tickets and more. 

Ether will only be accepted by the Decent.bet contracts at the time of the ICO and will 

be used to fund and run the platform for the foreseeable future.

4.0 THE HOUSE 

 

Unlike traditional centralized casinos and online gambling platforms, Decent.bet offers 

a transparent house that its users can participate in.  

 

4.1 DBET House Credits 

 

The house allows users to purchase DBET house credits at the start of every session 

which are composed of three month periods.  Session 0 will begin with a house credit 

buying period for every user during which no profit distribution will take place. From 

Session 1 onwards, users will be able to redeem profits for their house credits at the 

end of every session with the distribution of profit being based on the proportionality of 

house credits that they have held in comparison to the total house credits bought out 

from the house. 100% of all house profits will be distributed among house credit holders 

of which 5% is to be reserved for a winning DBET house credit holder lottery. 

 

 

4.2 Obtaining DBET House Credits 

 

All DBET house credits are purchasable using DBETs and are locked up for the entire 

session before they can be redeemed for profits or rolled over to the next session. 

 

 

4.3 DBET House Credits Exchange 

 

For liquidation purposes, Decent.bet will offer a decentralized DBET house credits 

exchange which allows users to trade their house credits for DBETs at any time during 

the initial 11 weeks of a session. In the event a user has any house credits in active 

orders within the exchange during the profit distribution period, the house credits would 

be automatically liquidated when users claim their portion of the profit distribution.

5.0 SPORTS BETTING 

 

The initial offering at launch by Decent.bet is a sport betting platform with multiple 

sports offerings such as; Baseball, American Football, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Tennis, 

Soccer and more. 

 

All games, bets and outcomes on the platform will be saved on Smart Contracts. 

However, since there are issues with creating a completely decentralized sports betting 

platform in terms of having the right outcomes pushed to the contract and reducing the 

possibilities of different attacks and methods to game the system, Decent.bet will be 

pushing the games and outcomes onto the contract using trusted addresses. Although 

this brings in an aspect of centralization to the platform, all games, odds and outcomes 

being pushed in would be transparent and verifiable on the blockchain. Users would be 

able to immediately view incorrect outcomes on the blockchain and report them, if any 

such occurrences were to happen. 

 

5.1 Decent.bet API 

 

The Decent.bet API will be used primarily to retrieve sports betting metadata. The API 

will deliver metadata required by the front-end such as team names, league names, 

event names etc., without bloating the smart contract with data that does not require 

decentralization and also helping to reduce gas fees. Games on the Smart Contracts 

would be identifiable by their IDs. 

  

5.2 Results & Verification 

 

All odds and outcomes obtained by the Decent.bet backend come from multiple sports 

betting feeds and line providers.  This approach reduces the chances of error while 

pushing odds and outcomes to the contract. To verify any of the results, users will be 

able to view the outcomes straight from the Decent.bet front-end or it's API and verifies 

the results pushed into the smart contract manually on the Ethereum blockchain. If any 

outcome is found to be in error users would be able to call for a correction and receive 

a refund.

6.0 CASINO 

 
In addition to the sports betting platform that will be available on launch, Decent.bet will 

launch a decentralized casino based on smart contracts and state channels. Slots will 

be available at launch and will be followed by a series of other casino games such as 

craps, roulette etc., which will be developed in line with our vision of mass adoption. 

 

6.1 State Channels 

 

With the current state of the Ethereum blockchain – relying on an on-chain oracle 

connected to a trusted source to act as an RNG i.e. random.org or WolframAlpha , 

users have to wait for a callback from a query which could take a minute or more due 

to being on-chain. Furthermore, Ethereum’s current limitations in terms of transactions 

per second dramatically disrupt the user experience by creating these delays which in 

turn would disenfranchise a large portion of our target potential users, traditional online 

gamblers, who are unaware of how blockchain gambling works.  

 

This led the Decent.bet team to use an alternative method to act as an RNG and settling 

games on-chain between the house and the user – state channels. State channels 

make use of the blockchain to initially deposit funds into the channel contract for both 

house and player before making the game available to play for the player off-chain 

using a turn-based system. The user and house exchange details for a turn using 

signed messages which enable final verification on-chain. 

 
 

*** IMPLEMENTATION INFO TO BE PROVIDED IN FINAL VERSION *** 
 
 

On the front-end, all users viewing closed channels would be able to reconstruct the 

RNG sequence for all their games and verify validity. The advantage of using this 

system is the speed at which games could be played and its scalability in comparison 

to a completely on-chain solution with the current state of the Ethereum network. With 

transactions only happening at the start and end of a channel contract rather than for 

every move – users would save significantly in gas fees, which would otherwise cost a 

significant amount of Ether over time.  



Page 14 of 29                                   
 

 

With future updates that have been proposed to Ethereum such as Casper and 

sharding – Ethereum would have the capacity to process a magnitude of times larger 

amount of transactions per second (~15 tx/sec currently to over 10,000+ tx/sec – Ref 

#3). This would enable Decent.bet to eventually switch to a completely decentralized 

solution for its casino games, whenever the proposed updates are ready. 

 

6.2 Slots 

 
 

Slot machines provide more profit for casinos than any other type of game. According 

to 2016 data, slot machines accounted for more revenue than all other casino games 

combined, with penny slots making up the most revenue. 

 

For example, an April to September 2016 Nevada Gaming Control Board Gaming 

Revenue Report (ref) shows that the “total gaming win” (the casino’s win) from slots 

was $7,066,306,000 USD (about $7 billion USD) in total, and the total table games win 

was $4,094,401,000 USD (about $4 billion USD). Even with sports gaming added in at 

$19,236,000 USD (about $19.2 million USD), no casino game revenue even gets close 

to slots. (Ref #1) 

 

Slots on the Decent.bet platform will have the advantage of being verifiable and 

transparent while being hosted on decentralized smart contracts. 

The slots contract will allow users to create channels between them and the house for 

initial deposits and final settlements. All game moves will be processed using a simple 

two-way communication over a REST API at the time of launch.  

 

Eventually, with a stable release of Whisper (Ref #2), Decent would switch to using the 

Whisper protocol for complete decentralized communication for its state channels.

6.3 Mechanics 

 



Page 15 of 29                                   
 

At launch, Decent.bet will offer multi-line slot machines consisting of 5 reels and up to 

5 lines. 

 

Bet sizes for each slot spin would be multiplied by the number of lines the player would 

like to play.  For example, if a user would like to spin with a bet size of 10 DBETs while 

playing 5 lines, the user would have to bet 50 DBETs while increasing chances of a 

payout using more lines. 

 

Payouts are based on left-to-right symbol repetitions for each line, starting from 3x 

symbol repetitions to 5x.  

 

The payout distribution is listed below for winning combinations of different symbols for 

each line. Each symbol is denoted by an alphabet – which would be substituted by their 

respective symbols in the actual game. 

 
3xA – 10 4xA - 20 5xA - 30 

3xB – 20 4xB - 40 5xB - 60 

3xC – 40 4xC - 80 5xC - 120 

3xD – 50 4xD - 100 5xD - 150 

3xE – 75 4xE - 150 5xE - 225 

3xF – 150 4xF - 300 5xF - 450 

3xG – 300 4xG - 600 5xG - 900 

 
 

Slots will consist of 5 reels containing 7 different symbols each with varying frequencies 

giving multiple winning combinations at different probabilities. The frequency 

distribution for each symbol in each reel is given below: 

 

S     R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 

A 4 4 7 6 7 

B 5 4 4 6 4 

C 4 6 2 3 3 

D 2 2 4 1 3 

E 4 2 2 2 1 

F 1 2 1 2 2 

G 1 1 1 1 1 

This gives us a distribution of 21 symbols for each reel.  



Page 16 of 29                                   
 

 

The total number of different combinations would now be 21^5 or 4,084,101 different 

combinations.Based on the reels distribution listed above, the probability of a winning 

combination would be 9.433165%  

 

Returns to users based on different winning combinations based on the reels 

distribution and payouts mentioned above would be around 93.08291%. 

 

100% of the profits generated would be distributed among holders of DBET House 

Credits as part of each session profit distributions.  As stated in 4.1 the 5% balance is 

reserved for a single lottery drawing. The game itself will create the experience of 

actually playing the slots in a casino and would be playable across multiple screen 

sizes. We believe that mobile support will go a long way to increase adoption and user 

retention. 

 

 

6.4 Craps 

 
 

Craps will be the second casino game on the Decent.bet platform.  The game will be 

offered with one table per player due to the user experience issues that would arise on 

a game with multiple players being required to push transactions into a smart contract.  

 

The craps game will be user-friendly and in-line with our vision to create a platform that 

is both transparent and provides a responsive user experience that will go a long way 

towards increasing adoption.  

 

Craps will also make use of state channels with pre-determined random numbers 

making use of blended seeds and their hashes. Users will always play against the 

house and will be able to choose between pass and don’t pass lines to start, before 

rolling their die.  

Once the die is rolled on the front-end, a random number is generated based on the 

turn and its respective blended seed. It then checks for the following conditions for a 

pass line bet;  



Page 17 of 29                                   
 

 

1. If the sum of the die is 7 or 11, the user wins the game. If the sum of the die is 2, 3 

or 12, the house wins the game. 

 

2. If the above conditions aren’t met, the previously retrieved sum is now set as the 

“point”. Now, the user and the house gets to roll repeatedly until either the point or a 7 

comes up. If the point comes up first, the user wins. If a 7 comes up first, the house 

wins. 

 

3. All user winnings are double of the amount that was bet.  

 

For don’t pass line bets, the conditions are swapped between the user and house.  

As with other Casino games on the platform, 100% of the profits generated would be 

distributed among holders of DBET House Credits as part of each session profit 

distributions. 

 
 

6.5 Other Games 

 
 

Over time, other casino games will be added on to the platform based on user 

demand in the form of smart contracts and state channels while making use of 

DBETs for all transactions. 



Page 18 of 29                                   
 

7.0 WINNINGS, PAYOUTS & PROFIT DISTRIBUTION 

 
 

On the Decent.bet platform, users will be able to buy DBET house credits for each 

session, a 3-month period. At the beginning of session 0 or the final week of any other 

session, users will be able to buy-in to the house by using DBETs to purchase DBET 

house credits. This essentially locks users’ DBETs into the house and allows it to be 

redeemed only at the end of a session, along with profits. 

 

DBET house credits will also be exchanged on the DBET house exchange in the future 

for DBETs anytime during a session thereby providing liquidity. DBET house credits 

can also be rolled over to the next session in the final week of the current session, 

locking in a users’ DBETs for another session while allowing them to redeem profits.  

 

Since smart contracts cannot automatically liquidate all DBET house credit holder’s 

due to its nature, at the beginning of every session following S1, DBET house credit 

holder’s will have to manually exchange their house credits to redeem their payouts. 

All DBET house credit holders will be notified through the front-end and via e-mail 

before each house credit buying period and at the beginning of every profit distribution 

period. 

 

Profits for a user during each session are calculated using the following equation -  

 

𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑠

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑠
  ×  (𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑠) 

 

 

Example: if the total purchased DBET house credits equate to 10,000,000 DBET 

house credits and the session profits amount to 4,000,000 DBETs – the profits split 

between the users are 3,800,000 DBETs which is 95% of the profits. Again, 5% is 

reserved for the session Lottery. 

 

In this scenario, if a user had purchased 20,000 DBET house credits, he/she would 



Page 19 of 29                                   
 

be entitled to redeem 
20,000

10,000,000
 × 3,800,000 for a sum of 7,600 DBETs. 

 

If for any reason the session profits are zero or below at the end of a session, users 

would be able to liquidate their DBET house credit holders and realize a loss. 



Page 20 of 29                                   
 

8.0 LOTTERY 

 

Lotteries will take place at the end of every session after profit distribution takes place. 

All DBET house credit holders with a minimum of 1,000 DBETs at the end of a session 

will automatically be given an entry into the session’s lottery for every 1,000 DBETs 

they own, up to a maximum of 5 entries.  The lottery does not require any manual 

interaction from the user. 

 

Lotteries work in a simple way; A function is called at the beginning of a session as 

long as it hasn't been called yet. The function requests a random number from 

random.org between 0 and the number of DBET house credit holders present in the 

DBET house credit holders array for the previous house session.  

 

The address present in the DBET house credit holders array at the index denoted by 

the random number that's returned from random.org will be deemed as the winner of 

the lottery.  

 

All winnings will be automatically transferred to the winner.

9.0 WHITE LABEL SOLUTIONS 

 

In line with Decent.bet’s vision of a fast and flawless user experience for our blockchain 

based gambling platform, it will offer white label solutions for other larger companies to 

adapt Decent.bet’s platform & technology to create their own houses which utilize their 

own custom lines and feeds. 

 

9.1 Requirements 

 
 

All outside companies looking to utilize Decent.bet for blockchain based gambling 

services will be required to hold at least 2,000,000 DBETs. Vetting would take place to 

ensure their track record as well as to verify compliance with appropriate regulations in 

the jurisdiction they are based in.  

 

9.2 White Labelled Houses 

 
 

Outside companies that are accepted into the platform are allowed to implement their 

own custom games and line feeds through the Decent.bet API. Once the API 

implementation is complete, separate smart contracts are created for each provider 

and users are allowed to switch between different providers from the platform.  

 

9.3 Initial House Buyouts 

 
 

Prior to the sale of white label houses to outside companies, users will have an 

opportunity to purchase DBET house credits to the newly created houses. These 

credits would have to be bought out by the companies at a pre-defined rate set by the 

house credit holders. For example, a new house that is introduced to users has 

1,000,000 credits bought in by the users. Users are now allowed to select a pre-defined 

rate to sell the house to companies at. Now, in this case, say users have selected a 

pre-defined rate of 1.2x, a company would have to pay 1,200,000 DBETs to all DBET 

house credit holders before being able to take control of the house. This allows users 

to decide which providers they would like on the platform, as well receive a financial 

incentive for doing so.

10.0 MULTI-PLATFORM USABILITY 

 

In line with Decent.bet's vision of mass market blockchain backed digital casino, betting 

front-ends will be available across multiple platforms to increase adoption and retention 

rates. Decent.bet will offer both a responsive web front-end as well as native mobile 

apps for both Android and iOS devices.  

 

With focus on games that are flexible in terms of transaction times – a significant 

limitation in Ethereum at the moment, sports betting and casino games like slots and 

craps will still be able to be played with a smooth and appealing user-experience.

11.0 DECENT C 

 

Decent.bet will establish a certified 501c (3) charity called Decent C for Humanity or 

Decent Charity for Humanity.  10% of the profits generated by the founders DBET 

house credits will be donated to Decent C for Humanity.  The obligated amount shall 

not exceed $50,000.00 per session donation. 

 

The focus of the charity will be to provide support for humanity worldwide.  The 

beneficiaries of the charity will be chosen in 2 ways, by the founders and by a vote 

through the community.

12.0 CROWDSALE 

 

Decent.bet will conduct a crowdsale September of 2017 offering DBET tokens to 

investors before a full launch of the platform. 

 

The crowdsale will be capped and 250,000,000 DBETs will be available for distribution 

during the duration of the crowdsale.  The crowdsale will continue until the cap is 

reached or 28 days has passed whichever comes first. At the end of the crowdsale, 

any remaining tokens will be burned. 

 

Also, the tokens distributed during the duration of the crowdsale will represent 70% of 

the total supply of coins. The remaining 30% will be minted at the end of the crowdsale 

and would be allocated as follows: 

 

18% time-locked founder’s share – withdrawable after 1 year. This incentivizes the 

Decent.bet team to develop the platform and remain motivated to grow token value at 

a steady rate. 

 

10% held by the contract that can only be used to establish the house.  This initial 

deposit into the house will be accounted as a contribution by the founders entitling the 

founders to the resulting DBET house credits profit. 

 

2% used for bounties – Bitcointalk signature campaigns, Social media campaigns, Blog 

posts, translations and more. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Page 25 of 29                                   
 

 

The distribution of Ether raised during the crowdsale will be used as follows: 

 
 

 
 

 

 

Development – 40% - Will be used to hire developers to the team for smart contract, 

front-end, and game development to ensure Decent.bet is on schedule for 

announcements on its roadmap and continues to bring in innovative ideas into the 

platform. 

 

Legal – 10% - Licenses, lawyer fees and other legal work/processes that are required 

to run a gambling platform legally. 

 

Marketing – 25% - Bringing in users through the use of marketing campaigns 

online/physically that educate and convert regular online/traditional gamblers to users 

of the Decent.bet platform. 

 

Operations – 25% - For all other operating expenses that would be required by the 

platform to ensure day to day operations and long-term growth. 



Page 26 of 29                                   
 

13.0 FUTURE POTENTIAL 

 
 

After the completion of the crowdsale, based on the amount raised, Decent.bet will be 

setting up a larger development team looking to add as many casino games onto the 

platform as possible in line with its vision of mass adoption.  

 

With a vast selection of casino games that will be transparent, auditable and verifiable 

using the Ethereum blockchain coupled along with a 100% profit payout to DBET house 

credit holders, Decent.bet will have a solid base to grow into a leading player in the 

global online casino market. 

 

With improvements to the current infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain, Decent.bet 

would also switch to a completely decentralized model for casino games as long as 

user experience would not be affected. 

 

From a sportsbook perspective, Decent.bet will be looking to add all popular sports/e-

sports that cater to regions across the entire world, to establish itself as the leading 

blockchain based sportsbooks globally. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Page 27 of 29                                   
 

14.0 RISKS INVOLVED 

 

14.1 Server Downtime 

 

With state channels, Decent.bet requires a mode of communication for gambling 

games to exchange data for each game move. At the time of launch, due to the lack of 

stable decentralized messaging protocols – Decent.bet will have to make use of a 

REST API hosted on regular cloud infrastructure to act as a mode of communication to 

conduct off-chain game moves between users and the house. As with any solution that 

relies on a client-server architecture, downtime could happen due to a number of 

unforeseen circumstances.  

 

However, with timeouts are embedded into each contract users are able to finalize and 

close channels themselves after the timeout period, ensuring their funds are not held 

in limbo while the servers are unable to communicate directly with users. 

 

To mitigate these negative effects and keep uptime at a maximum, Decent.bet will 

make use of high-end cloud infrastructure with multiple instances backed by load 

balancers along with DDOS protection. All on-chain events will also be watched by 

separate instances to ensure even if API servers are offline, on-chain transactions such 

as closing channels could be performed by the house. Once Ethereum’s Whisper 

launches a stable release, all communication between users and the house will be 

switched to use Whisper rather than the REST API. 

 
 

14.2 Trusted Data Providers  

 
 

All sports betting odds, lines and outcomes on the Decent.bet platform will be pushed 

by the addresses owned by Decent.bet. Users of the platform would have to rely on 

Decent.bet to push in correct data which otherwise would lead to undesired 

consequences. To prevent issues from arising in this aspect, Decent.bet will make use 

of data from multiple data providers and verify all data before pushing any data on-



Page 28 of 29                                   
 

chain. However, if any mistake does arise, users would be able to report the bet, call 

for a correction and receive refunds. 

 

In the future, Decent.bet will look into implementing decentralized oracles that would 

be incentivized to push the right results through a reward system, with punishment for 

malicious activity. 

 

14.3 Ethereum Blockchain Dependence 

 

Since Decent.bet is a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain, it ultimately relies 

on the state of the Ethereum Network for its long-term success. Any unforeseen 

incident on the Ethereum Network could negatively affect Decent.bet in terms of 

performance, stability, security etc.  

 

Additionally, Decent.bet will also be limited by the limitations of the Ethereum Network, 

may it be in terms of speed, scale or any other factor. However, with the proposed 

updates that will drastically improve the state of the Ethereum Network, Decent.bet will 

only be set to improve in terms of offering complete decentralized/on-chain solutions 

rather than relying on layer 2 solutions like state channels for fast, verifiable gambling 

games.
