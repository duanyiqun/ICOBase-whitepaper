Token As A Pledge for Suretly

https://surco.in

v.1.6

https://surco.in
https://surco.in


Short description
SUR is a utility token which can be used as a pledge in a 
Suretly crowdvouching platform. It means that there is a 
possibility to use SUR-tokens as a method of ensuring 
guarantee on a granted surety in the Suretly app.

There are two types of tokens available based on Ethereum 
and Waves. Tokens are equivalent. 

Suretly is a provider of an international crowdvouching 
platform. The company offers users an investment 
alternative, which allows customers to make money 
vouching for people who need an urgent loan. This system 
works in a similar fashion with peer-2-peer lending, but customers do not lend 
money to each other directly. Instead, they just vouch for borrowers who apply for 
a loan through lending partners. Customers can find borrowers that are looking 
for their loan’s guarantors. The voucher can check the borrower’s profile and 
choose whether to vouch for the borrower if their default risk and earning amount 
suit them.

What is crowdvouching?
Crowdvouching is the practice of financially securing a loan repayment by 
vouching monetary contributions from a large number of people.

Unlike P2P lending, Vouchers do not lend money directly to the Borrowers but 
guarantee to repay the loan to the Lender in case of Borrower's default.

Vouchers act as a collective mind in order to determine whether to approve loans 
or not. Liability for each loan is divided among all Vouchers. Each Voucher 
approval serves like an insurance of the loan capped at $10 USD. Since the 
vouching range is between $2 and $10, each Borrower needs to find dozens of 
Vouchers provided by Suretly platform. In order for the loan to be approved, the 
entire loan amount should be guaranteed by the vouchers.

Crowdvouching benefits

No cost for participants. Vouchers do not loan any money to anyone, but 
guarantee to pay part of the debt in the event of a default. 

Distribution of risks. Participants vouch only for a portion of a loan. 

Quick return. Participants can receive their profit the day after a loan is issued. 

Lower borrowing rates. Minimising risk lightens investors’ needs to incorporate 
higher interest rates. 

Anonymity. A borrower’s personal data is not disclosed to investors. 

Good opportunity to improve credit history. People with less-than-perfect 
credit history have chance to improve their credit history and gain the status in 
market. 

Low default rate. As demonstrated from 4 months of crowd-vouching test results 
in Eastern Europe, the default rate is significantly lower than in other credit 
products.

Crowdvouching in micro-financing
Crowdvouching can be potentially used for any type of loans or credits. But 
briefly we’re focusing on small, short-term loans market (including short term 
loans). It allows us to offer bigger rewards to investors with a higher risk level. 

Besides, the micro-financing market is one of the largest among loan markets.
The main group of consumers of micro-loans is the so-called “underserved 
customers” - people who struggle with one, two or all three of these financial 
challenges, according to CFSI: 

Sources: Credit Challenged: 53 million U.S. individuals are unscorable due to thin or nonexistent FICO credit 
file data, while 20% of those with FICO scores, or 38 million people, have scores below 600. Expanding Credit 
Opportunities, FICO, 2017; US Average FICO Score Hits 700: A Milestone for Consumers, FICO, April 2017.

According to CFSI,  there are approximately 91 million credit-challenged U.S. 
adults with subprime credit scores below 600, or are unscorable due to a lack of 
sufficient credit file information. In 2016, this consumers spent $39.4 billion on 
fees and interest for Single Payment Credits in the United States only.

Demand for such loans in developing countries is even higher. For example, 
according to the results of August 2016, the overall portfolio of micro-finance 
companies in Russia amounted to as much as 80 million rubles (http://
raexpert.ru/releases/2016/Aug29e/)

Role of SUR-tokens 
There is a possibility to use all issued SUR-tokens as a pledge.

In Suretly app customers can observe a list of borrowers who applied for short 
term loans. Profiles contain photo, city, age, gender and the statistical data on 
the timely loan repayment among borrowers of a similar category. Each customer 
can vouch for a borrower he likes and instantly get profit for each issued loan. 
SUR-tokens can be used as a guarantee and must be enrolled to the account in 
the app. After the loan is approved, the tokens get frozen in the amount 
according to the exchange rate. If the borrower won't pay off his loan later the 
voucher loses tokens in the guaranteed amount
