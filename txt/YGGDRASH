Introduction 

The future we think… 

Our future will become ever more complex, and more transactions and data will be created. As it has been 
and always will be, data management is one of the most important tools to navigate this complexity.  
What will happen if we maintain the current system where we keep all the data in one place and manage all 

the points that are linked to each other? It means all the risks are concentrated in one place. If people keep 
choosing central points where all their personal data is stored in order to use services and to maintain their 
lives, is this the right decision or the best choice?  

What if such a central point stops to operate? Or what if people or centralized organizations use our valuable 
information for the wrong reasons? Will we still be able to trust the system after all? It is questionable 
whether we should continue to trust current centralized systems in which the safety and integrity of our data 

is not guaranteed.  

Even if we cannot transfer all of the internet, which is a sea of information, into the blockchain world, we shall 

address the necessity of this blockchain platform as a first step heading toward the future.  
All blockchains have their own governance. While blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are different, 
each has its own goal and direction and presents different solutions. 

YGGDRASH acknowledges such difference in thinking and is pursuing a platform which will enable different 
methods to solve these issues together.  

The ideology of blockchain has changed. There are still difficulties in how each blockchain project resolves 
issues and problems in reality. Users who use the network are concentrated on one blockchain, so all 

transaction data is concentrated in one block, causing negative effects on applications in the real world. This 
might cause another centralization of the decentralized information of networks, showing the limits of 
blockchain performance. If too many people try to register in a block at the same time, a bottleneck will occur 

which is an essential task for the P2P network to tackle, no matter how fast the speed of a blockchain 
connection is made.  

Many blockchain projects are still trying to resolve these problems. The YGGDRASH project will contribute to 
solve them and subsequently make the blockchain ecosystem much healthier. Our future will become more 

complex, and more transaction and data will be created. As it has been and always will be, the data 
management is one of the most important factors.

1. Summary 

1.1 Why another blockchain?  

1.1.1 Transaction processing performance, abusive, self-interest driven competition  

         between block verification nodes, and sync speed of blockchain 

What is transaction speed (TPS) / throughput, in other words, transaction processing performance? 
Basically, it is a measure of how many transactions can be processed per unit of time. Many major 

blockchains today are experiencing difficulties due to the dramatic increase in the number of transactions 
and size of DApp data. In case of existing centralized platforms, this issue can be solved by increasing the 
number of servers along with data traffic increase. However, the recently introduced blockchains have 

inherent limitations. The computations necessary to complete each transaction in the current decentralized 
DB environment and P2P network resources with different processing performance slow down the overall 
network. In addition, the consensus process between nodes makes this problem even worse and more 

complex.  

Inseparably related to the processing performance of a blockchain are the block validation nodes: in other 

words, the economic incentive for miners. Bitcoin, the first generation of blockchains, believed that it could 
create a transparent and stable ecosystem through the voluntary participation of miners by rewarding them 

based on mathematical proofs and game theory, such as proof of work (POW). Due to explosive growth in 
the number of transactions, however, the consensus process is governed by abusive and self-interest driven 
block verifiers. They line up transactions and DApp data based on profitability, resulting in higher cost for the 

blockchain environment. Even though such transactions can yield high value for the verifiers, using lower 
fees slows transactions down or leaves them not executed permanently. This is the reality of the blockchain 
environment today.  

What is not discussed significantly in the blockchain ecosystem until now is the matter of increased block 
size and sync speed. Since the structure of a blockchain connects a block with another block, the size of all 

blocks increases and block sync speed decreases along with the increase in transaction volumes as time 
goes by. Since 2012, the average size of a block in a blockchain and the time for the block to sync have 
doubled every year. As of February 2018, the total data of Bitcoin is 150 GB and the block sync takes 14 

days on average. This issue hinders the participation of common people in the blockchain ecosystem and 
brings a negative result in which the nature of decentralization turns into the centralized blockchain. As such, 
most of the major blockchain projects today struggle to solve issues of blockchain capacity and sync speed 

in order to apply blockchain to the real world in business, such as embedding blockchain technology into IoT 
devices.

1.1.2 The current situation of Bitcoin 

When Bitcoin, the first generation of blockchain, was introduced for the first time, the main reasons why it 
received tremendous attention were because of its vision to offer decentralization-based security, fast 

remittance, and 'near zero commission fee'. Unfortunately the reality ended up being not exactly ‘fast’ for 
remittances. This goal became almost impossible due to transaction delays and unauthorized transactions. 
Fees per transaction have exceeded $ 55 on average over the last three months. As a result, paying for 

goods and small transactions became impractical. Why do these problems occur? 

Most of the public blockchain projects failed to address the following issues:  
1) processing speed of a decentralized DB  
2) designing economic incentives for nodes created/shared by a decentralized DB.  

The following figures clearly show the current situation Bitcoin faces; 

“51 minutes" 
Average time it takes to complete a single Bitcoin transaction during the past 30 days (BlockchainInfo.com) 

“55 dollar" 
Average transaction fee per 1 Bitcoin over the last 3 months (blockchain.info/charts) 

“214,817” 
Number of transactions floating now in the Bitcoin network now without being included in the block  
(blockchain.info/charts) 

“150 GB & 14 days” 
Current size of total blocks in Bitcoin and time required to sync (bc.daniel.net.nz) 

“30.14 Terawatt” 
The amount of electricity consumed by the Bitcoin network during 1 year is 30.15TW. 

This is exceeding the total power consumption of Ireland (25TW a year)  
(Digiconomist, a media outlet specialized in cryptocurrencies)

1.1.3 The current situation of Ethereum 

Ethereum, the second generation of blockchains, is a platform to operate various DApps using smart 
contracts, SNS, and e-voting. It also functions as a cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum also has the 

following issues: 1) limited scalability because all DApp data is recorded and processed in the single 
blockchain of Ethereum, 2) limitation of the economic incentives similar to those of Bitcoin.  

The following describes the current limitations of Ethereum; 

We believe YGGDRASH project could solve problems listed above with current blockchain projects carry.  

“Crypto Kitty"  
On November 28 2017, due to the popularity of Crypto Kitty, a DApp on Ethereum, in which a virtual cat 
can be sold and purchased using Ethereum, the number of transactions in the Ethereum network 

increased by 6 times in a day, which resulted in network paralysis.  

“Ethereum Gas(fee) issue”  
Ethereum is designed for users of the network to pay gas fees for Turing-Completeness and security 
reasons. It is a commission policy that users used in traditionally centralized services (The EOS token 
policy sounds more reasonable here for example).  

“Issue of fee payment in case of interlocking between DApps"  
When numerous DApps launch on the Ethereum platform, these DApps operate as one service through 

interlocking (when the independent commission policy is executed by each DApp). Users should pay 
commissions every time to each unknown DApp (of course, as soon as all the services are 
commercialized, most DApps will be integrated to create a better structured platform).  

“In case DApps are not executed or won’t be executed permanently”  
On the Ethereum platform, a person who pays a fee is a user but the person who executes the relevant 

service is a verifier. Verifiers are preferentially validating relatively profitable DApps, whereas low margin 
DApps are rarely or may never be implemented.  

“Attacker costs and user costs”  
It creates costs in both cases because it is difficult to distinguish attackers and users under the same fee 
policy. The dilemma is that the costs should be low for users and high for attackers.

2. YGGDRASH  
YGGDRASH aka a world tree, is a channel connecting all blockchains. The purpose of the YGGDRASH 

project is to connect all blockchains using a trust-based multi-dimensional blockchain. It hopes to redesign all 
services on the internet into a blockchain platform. 

2.1 Elements of YGGDRASH 
YGGDRASH consists of a Stem Chain and Branch Chains; the Stem Chain provides the blockchain 

ecosystem wherein all Branch Chains communicate with each other and are fused. 

Origin of YGGDRASH (Yggdrash)  

Yggdrash = Yggdrasil + Hash 

Yggdrasil is an immense mythical tree that connects wells of the world and locations from the underground 

and to the heaven: “hash” stands for hashed values used in blockchain transactions and networks.

�6



2.1.1 Stem Chain 

The Stem Chain is the main blockchain which is the root of the YGGDRASH ecosystem. It is also an 
aggregate and a blockchain containing information of all Branch Chains. The Stem Chain is optimized for 

transaction processing scalability and expandability by storing only minimum information such as the 
address of each Branch Chain. In addition, it connects each Branch Chain by referring the address of each 

Branch Chain and is able to manage the full life-cycle (creation / modification / destruction) of each chain.  

2.1.2 Branch Chain 

A Branch Chain is a DApp and an independent blockchain at the same time. Since the Branch Chain itself is 
a blockchain, it can naturally select the agreed and desired algorithm and form its own blockchain 

governance. A Branch Chain eventually reaches the level of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).  

A Branch Chain should not be confused with a Side Chain. This is a very important concept. Existing 

channels between blockchains should be connected by artificial technology like Atomic Swaps. YGGDRASH 
however can naturally refer/connect other Branch Chains at the same time once the Branch Chain is 
connected with the Stem Chain, which can create an environment where properties between chains are 

easily transacted. In addition, since a Branch Chain is operated as a independent blockchain, it is not 
influenced by overloading and failure of transactions of other Branch Chains.  

YEED is the internal token/cryptocurrency used in the YGGDRASH project. You can find more details about 
YEED in the later sections of this whitepaper.  

The types of Branch Chains are as follows; 

1. Immunity Branch Chain 
Branch Chain used in the YGGDRASH platform; it doesn’t consume YEED and is not eliminated from the 
list. 

2. Mutable Branch Chain 
Branch Chain created by users; it consumes YEED at regular intervals. 

3. Instant Branch Chain 
Branch Chain created by users; it does not consume YEED but exists only for a certain period of time (it 
can be created only by users who have a certain level of trust).  

4. Test / Private Branch Chain 
Branch Chain not connected to YGGDRASH; it is used for test and private purposes (The Stem Chain 

does not need to be aware of this chain; it is shared by limited users who know the information of this 
branch or owner of this chain). 

�7



2.1.3 Important Branch Chains 

1) Internal Currency Chain: YEED 

Why does the real world we live in require currency? We think that the main purpose of money is a means of 

transaction, but money is one of the most powerful tools to control and govern society. YEED, the currency of 
the YGGDRASH ecosystem, is one of the tools used to maintain our network while it also works as a means 
of transaction. However, the biggest reason of its existence is to connect and maintain a large number of 

blockchain networks connected to the YGGDRASH network.  

In general, if a new blockchain is created, it is not automatically registered to the Stem Chain of 

YGGDRASH. YEED is used to connect the blockchain to the main network of YGGDRASH, and YEED will 
be gradually consumed over time.  

The new Branch Chain in the YGGDRASH network can have tremendous opportunities in which the 
blockchain resources and service partners can be found and easily connected.  

2) Reputation Score Evaluation Chain: Sacred Water 
Why should users in a blockchain and cryptocurrency system pay a network fee? The reasons to charge 

network fees in most blockchains are as follows;  

 1. To compensate miners who create blocks and maintain the network. Since the number of blocks are 

limited, the miners prefer transaction requests paying higher fees in the block.  

 2. To prevent malicious users such as hackers from attacking the network. If the network fee is zero, 

malicious users will cause an infinite number of transactions to paralyze the network or create 
meaningless information to register in the block 

YGGDRASH measures reputation scores and reliability based on resources, such as time, the resource 
anyone has and can spend the same amount of, to benefit legitimate users and to limit malicious users. The 
more time and beneficial activities you contribute to the network of YGGDRASH, the higher your reputation 

score becomes and the greater the benefits you can get. One of them is a lower fee.  

Users with a high reputation score don’t have to pay any fees when using our network. It is the same 

mechanism that customers with high credit scores benefit from when they don’t have to pay fees while using 
certain services of a bank.  

There are many other benefits that can be provided to users with high reputation scores, other than free of 
charge services. For example, users with top ratings are given a higher share of newly issued YEED. As 
such, a policy that compensates beneficial contributions in the network is made possible.  

In the real world we live in, can reputation be traded as a resource? It is difficult to assign someone’s high 
reputational score to other people. For example, a person with a certain reputational level might transfer his 

score to others and lower his or her own score. It is the duty of the YGGDRASH community to develop and 

�8



improve ways how to execute these kinds of policies. To earn a reputation score in YGGDRASH ecosystem, 

users should contribute to and invest time on the YGGDRASH network. When users accumulate trust or 
reputation in order to adversely affect the network, they are detected by other network participants or 
surveillance systems, reducing their scores. In addition, all options are possible such as eliminating benefits 

like fee waivers, resources in YGGDRASH, and the right to build trust by designing the policy accordingly. 
The most important asset in YGGDRASH is not YEED but trust score which can benefit many others in the 
network. YGGDRASH will distribute more benefits and privileges to many participants who want to create a 

healthy ecosystem, and will create a blockchain ecosystem to grow together. 

3) Reputation Score Creation Chain: Sacred Water Fountain 

The creation of a reputation score of network participants is conducted in the Reputation Score Creation 

Chain. It is the algorithm designed to increase the score when beneficial activities are detected in the 
YGGDRASH ecosystem. If the nodes are inactive, the score cannot be obtained or increased. At the same 
time, YGGDRASH will run a system to monitor and punish users who intend to obtain a reputation score 

maliciously. 

2.2 Advantages of YGGDRASH  

2.2.1 The smart contract data capacity issue is resolved 

The smart contracts of Ethereum add value to the decentralized system of blockchains. Smart contracts 

contribute to the creation of a transparent and efficient blockchain ecosystem by allowing numerous 
transactions to follow an automated agreement that could not have been realized in the real world. However, 
it also faces the limit of capacity by loading numerous smart contracts into the blockchain.  

In fact, if the issue of data capacity is not resolved in developing decentralized applications made of smart 
contracts, we cannot create the desired business applications. How can we resolve this critical issue? Our 

answer is that if only integral information of the smart contract is uploaded into the blockchain and the binary 
file is received through another path in the network, the limitations of data capacity with smart contracts can 
be resolved. In addition, the programming language of smart contracts will not be constrained, and the 

hurdles of development of smart contracts will become significantly lower.  

2.2.2 Improvement of processing performance through blockchain network sharding 

YGGDRASH allows network sharding using multi-dimensional blockchain features. First of all, Branch 

Chains that do sharding should have the same governance, and each branch must have the other Branch 
Chains’ sharding information.  

The following example shows sharding with two branches. The criteria to process sharding are assumed 
based on the account number of each branch chain (e.g. odd or even numbers).  

�9



!  

In case of sharding with 2 Branch Chains as above, if moved from Yeed Branch 1 to Yeed Branch 1, only one 
trade occurs in general. However, if moved from Yeed Branch 1 to other branches, Yeed Branch 1 will have 
two confirmation processes taken by Yeed Branch 2 with the asset escrowed.  

This can be described as follows; 

The example above shows sharding performed with two different Branch Chains. In case of sharding like in 

the example above, the sharding writing performance (transaction processing performance) is the same with 
one Branch Chain. However, the performance improves significantly when sharding is performed with more 
than 3 branches. The performance of a single Branch Chain of YGGDRASH is expected to be between 

1,000 and 10,000 TPS, and blockchain network sharding can improve processing performance even further. 
Using our blockchain technology, business applications that require large amounts of transactions for micro-
payments can be served effectively on the YGGDRASH platform.  

Sharding effect = same branch 50% + other branch (3) 50% = branch sharding count / 2

2.2.3 Akashic system –improvement in node sync speed by applying BRA (Block 

Reassembling Algorithm) 

Most blockchains that consist on the main net today provide a full node (wallet) that can be utilized. Various 

functions such as smart contracts can be executed on those networks. However, most cryptocurrency users 
are using cryptocurrency exchanges or light client node (wallet) services to trade cryptocurrencies and use 
smart contracts. This is because it is difficult to form a full node on their own. One of the biggest constraints 

is the time and economic inefficiency involved due to the need of all the blocks in the blockchain to be  
downloaded and synchronized.  

For example, the synchronization for Bitcoin takes about 14 days while that for Ethereum takes about 8 days 
(4.8 million blocks / as of January 2018).  

Those who want to form a full node on a different blockchain platform do not synchronize from the Genesis 
block (the first block of its blockchain). By receiving a wallet where blocks are synchronized to a certain 
extent and shared over the internet through a P2P network, they can save time on synchronization. Still the 

nature of widely used P2P networks today (such as Torento etc.) might come with the risk of carrying viruses. 
One receives the wallet from available servers where reliability and integrity is not guaranteed.  

YGGDRASH will realize an effective and stable block synchronization through the Block Reassembling 
Algorithm (BRA).  

The Block Reassembling Algorithm consists of 3 components as follows;  
• Akashic Record (AR): A set of values of all transactions before N blocks 
• Block Box (BB): A set of blocks containing N blocks in one box 

• Original Block (OR): Blocks of general blockchain 

The Akashic Record is a set of data that stores the results of all transactions (the result value of transactions 
from all accounts) from a Genesis block to a block at a specific checkout point. A Block Box is a set of blocks 
containing several blocks in one box.  

In order to realize the BRA, the result value of AR and BB is hashed and saved in the block according to the 
specified policy. The actual binary data of AR and BB is stored to the file sharing on the P2P network of 

YGGDRASH. When a node is synchronized using the BRA, the block data is downloaded in parallel from 

�11



YGGDRASH’s file sharing on the P2P network, and then compared with the hash value of the BRA stored in 

the YGGDRASH block to guarantee integrity and security.  

YGGDRASH proposes a method in which all network participants can easily participate in the network 

without losing the advantages of a blockchain network. The BRA can also be an option to synchronize a full 
block, depending on the users.  

The following examples show how to increase the actual block sync speed by using the BRA; 

• Scenario 
 - Let’s assume that there is a new node at a time when the current block number is 4,890,002 

• BRA operational policy 
 - AR (Akashic Record): The Akashic Record stores the result value per every 100,000 blocks 

 - BB (Block Box): A Block Box is created for every 10,000 blocks 

• Result of BRA application 

As you can see above, BRA is a technology that can minimize block sync rate and node resources as the 
size of a block increases. Ultimately, we believe that we are able to solve the issue of block size which 

current blockchains are striving to tackle. As a result, it is expected that blockchain technology can be 
applied to many business areas such as Internet of Things (with limited processing power and data storage) 
and other applications.  

2.2.4 The File Sharing on the P2P Network - Solving the issue of storage capacity 

The file sharing network of YGGDRASH registers smart contracts, Akashic records, block boxes, and chain 
resources. The application exists not only in the code, but it is operated with various types of resources that 

offer the service of the application.  

YGGDRASH provides an option to overcome data limitation on the blockchain through the file sharing on the 

P2P network, which will enable a more diverse and varied blockchain services. 

• YGGDRASH block sync speed 
1 AR + 9 BB+ 2 REGIONAL BLOCK SYNC TIME = About 30 minutes 

• Block sync speed of other blockchains 
4,890,002 BLOCK * BLOCK SYNC TIME = About 8 days

�12



2.2.5 Interoperability is guaranteed on multi-dimensional blockchains 

The reason why YGGDRASH is called a multi-dimensional blockchain is that it can connect  blockchains with 
other blockchains created at a different time. In order to connect different blockchains, the time concept in a 

blockchain must be understood. Bitcoin creates one block every 10 minutes and Ethereum creates one block 
every 15 seconds.  

How can those two different blockchains be connected? YGGDRASH solved this task by applying Akashic 
slice, the chain connection protocol. At the time when the data of different blockchains is exchanged, the 
result of the block of the node is stored as if shooting a snapshot of that exact moment. For example, let's 

suppose that a person is looking out through a window and a car is passing by. He can prove that the car 
passed the window by taking a photo of the car at that exact moment in time.  

If other blockchain platforms can connect to the Stem Chain of YGGDRASH through the chain connection 
protocol designed by us, our network resources (YEED, Reputation, Different DApps) can be used in their 
blockchain platforms as well. Eventually, existing block chain platforms can be connected to YGGDRASH 

and operated like a Branch Chain if the governance issue is resolved.  

2.2.6 Blockchain Starter & Smart Kit 

YGGDRASH provides blockchain development toolkits for independent blockchain developers. Each toolkit 
is customized for blockchain development that satisfies the schedule, flexibility, applicability, and 
convenience of development depending on business requirement and strategy.  

YGGDRASH would like to set aside a separate budget to fund an open source environment and the 
development of blockchain technology. This is one of incubation projects that YGGDRASH plans. The 

incentive will be paid depending on the contribution of each project participant. Anyone interested in or 
wanting to contribute to the blockchain technology development can participate and use this resource. The 
blockchain development toolkit is offered in two types; 

1. Blockchain Starter Kit (Blockchain infrastructure development kit) 
The blockchain infrastructure development kit modularizes the basic elements of a blockchain to help 
developers quickly apply blockchain technology to their businesses. 

• Consensus Algorithm (PoW, PoS, PoI, etc.) 
• Encryption Algorithms (ECDSA, Hash, etc.) 
• Data Structures (Merkle tree, Patricia tree, etc.) 
• Node / Wallet Configuration (Full node, Light node, Web node, etc.) 
• Special Functions (Smart Contract, Zero-Knowledge Proof, etc.) 

�13



2. Blockchain Smart Kit 
The Blockchain Smart kit will contribute to the development of new technologies to overcome limitations 
of blockchains such as sharding and lightning networks, and allow the blockchain technology to be 
attached to other business enabling technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and 

Genetics.  

The role of YGGDRASH is to grant an incentive to create such an environment. We wish that 

participants with passion and competency in the blockchain industry will become pioneers who can 
contribute to the world as others did. 

• Scalability (Sidechain, Sharding, Lightning Network, etc.) 
• Interoperability Technologies (Multidimensional Blockchains, Atomic Swap, etc.) 
• Data Capacity Saving Technology (Akashic Record, Block Box, File sharing on P2P Network, etc.) 
• 4th Industrial Revolution Technology (Big Data, IoT, AI, RT, etc.) 

�14



2.3 Governance in YGGDRASH 

2.3.1 Consensus Algorithm 

YGGDRASH will develop a DPOA (Delegated Proof of Authority), a self-consensus algorithm, to ensure 
faster performance than any other consensus algorithm by selecting the node with the highest reputation 
score as a representative through the reputation evaluation chain.  

You might have a question on the delegated representative. This node is verified through a high reputation 
score from the Reputation Evaluation Chain through its activity to benefit and to contribute to the blockchain 

network. Since YGGDRASH is a multidimensional structure separating the Stem Chain from the Currency 
Chain, any direct financial incentive is not awarded to the representative. The block validation in 
YGGDRASH creates blocks according to a specified algorithm (Round Robin method or Time Series 

method, etc.), and block creation takes 10 seconds.  

In addition, each representative node is free from a single point of failure by delegating its representative 

authority to its sub-node under the authority delegation policy in YGGDRASH. 

!  
The diagram above describes a node in the configuration of YGGDRASH. The ones expressed in A-D 

alphabet are representative nodes, and alphabetic-numeric nodes are sub-nodes of each representative 
node. The 14 block creation of nodes is randomly operated by the structured algorithm, and in case of any 
failure or delay of a specific node, it can overcome a single point of failure as the transfer process of 

authority immediately occurs.  

In conclusion, DPOA in YGGDRASH is an advanced consensus algorithm, enhancing security and 

processing performance.  

�15



2.3.2 Governance of Representatives 

As mentioned above, the representative node is selected through YGGDRASH’s Reputation Evaluation 
Chain. The representative is finally elected by a committee of YGGDRASH representatives, representing 
more than 3/4 of members and agreed to by more than half of those members. The Committee determines 

and implements operations, discipline, currency, YEED and policies of the YGGDRASH network. In addition, 
the representative can delegate, transfer, or withdraw its representative right through the authority delegation 
model, which manages authority.  

The representatives of YGGDRASH will be constituted in each continent based on criteria of stability and 

security, and the number of representatives will be set as the ideal number through the test net process.  

2.3.3 Incentive for Representative 

Base on a multidimensional blockchain characteristic, there is no direct monetary compensation policy for 
representatives in the YGGDRASH network. However, YGGDRASH honours a representative and benefits 

him by creating an immunity chain without consuming YEED and paying less or no fees in our network.  

The authority of representatives in YGGDRASH may be transferred or suspended in case of violation of 

consensus rules such as not participating in block inspections and malignant behaviour. If cheating with 
malicious intent is found, the representative will be kicked out immediately. In addition, if the representative 
node is reported to be infringed and this is validated, the compromised representative will be deactivated and 

the declarant receives a certain compensation according to the reporting policy.  

2.3.4 Currency policy of YEED in YGGDRASH  

YEED is the currency used in YGGDRASH. 10 billion YEED is issued at the beginning. Burning of YEED will 

occur for at least one year and the total volume will decrease accordingly. The transaction fee in 
YGGDRASH will differ depending on participants’ reputation scores in the network. Accounts with certain 
levels of reputation or trust will enjoy a waiver of transaction fees.  

The most important area for YEED usage is creating a new Branch Chain. The amount of YEED grants and 
decides the life of the Branch Chain and, as time goes by, YEED is consumed. As the ecosystem of 

YGGDRASH develops and enriches, the value of YEED and the Stem and Branch Chains grow together.  

Fees from accounts with low credibility are used as the budget for YGGDRASH Incubation, which further 

helps the YGGDRASH ecosystem grow and prosper. 

�16



2.4 USE CASES 

2.4.1 Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) 

This is literally a "decentralized exchange". All deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrencies are made solely 
in the blockchain of DEX. It is possible to trade cryptocurrencies directly in YGGDRASH's personal wallet. 
This wallet connects directly to the blockchain rather than the tokenized internal wallets provided by 

exchange platforms today. In a truly decentralized exchange, random manipulation and harmful activities 
such as blocking deposits and withdrawals are almost impossible. Since it benefits from the security of the 
blockchain, DEX are free from system hacking and leakage of personal information like we often see today 

with existing centralized exchanges.  

DEX in YGGDRASH will become a game-changer in decentralized exchange platforms.  Delays of 

transactions and hacking attempts will be prevented and reliability ensured.  

2.4.2 DApp Store of Blockchain (DSB) 

A Branch Chain of YGGDRASH is a service and a DApp at the same time. In the Ethereum platform, the 
issue of inefficiency of data storage has been on the rise. Users who want to execute DApp of A had to 

receive all DApp data of B, C, and D that have no relation to execute that of A.  

On the other hand, YGGDRASH requires only downloading the Branch Chain which is related to the specific 

DApp. This is due to the fact that each DApp is an independent blockchain and service. It is comparable to 
the fact that you don’t have to download the complete movie library of a torrent website if you only want to 

download the Star Wars movie. YGGDRASH provides an environment like the App Store of Apple in which 
users can easily search and download the blockchain DApp they want. Can you imagine what the future will 
be like? This can be realized on the DApp Store platform of YGGDRASH. 

2.4.3 Our daily life in the near future 

The following is a situation imaginable in the near future: Peter sets a business meeting on his smartphone 
with a certain location and at a certain time. When he leaves the building, an unmanned vehicle is waiting for 
him. When he gets in the car, it drives him to the location via an optimal path. Upon arrival at the destination, 

he gets off the car and heads to the meeting.  

How does YGGDRASH operate in this situation? As soon as the meeting schedule is set, YGGDRASH (or a 

DApp), which is installed on his smartphone, calls the nearest unmanned car. When the closest and most 
reputable unmanned vehicle is assigned, the car immediately arrives at the pick-up point and waits for Peter. 
The cost for the ride will be uploaded soon after Peter gets in the car and will be paid immediately upon 

arrival.  

Right after the payment is made, the reputation of the unmanned car rises and the revenue from the 

payment is automatically distributed to the relevant account of the unmanned car branch chain. A person 

�17



who wants to invest in the unmanned vehicle can invest by purchasing a token of a branch chain operating 

the unmanned vehicle. If Peter does not show up, the reputation score of Peter will be reduced and there will 
be a disadvantage in cost and time for calling an unmanned vehicle next time.  

3. Summary of YGGDRASH  

3.1 What kind of, discriminate, Blockchain? 

YGGDRASH proposes the most practical and achievable ways to overcome some of the most important 
challenges of other blockchains;  
1) inherently slow processing speed due to decentralization (though decentralized systems will mostly 

remain slower than centralized ones) and  
2) the issue of economic incentives that should inevitable to maintain the block chain network using the 
validation node of unspecified individuals  
3) the increased block sizes and slowed down block sync speed.  

We propose the most practical and achievable ways to overcome those issues. 

3.1.1 Independence and processing performance of each blockchain is guaranteed 

1) Optimized performance of main chain processing 
The Stem Chain of YGGDRASH serves as the path to connect all Branch Chains and realizes the optimization of 
processing performance and capacity as follows:  

• Lightening size of block data 
Data stored in the Stem Chain minimizes size of the data itself by storing only minimal information such 
as the address of each Branch Chain. This reduces the issue of data size that linearly increases over 
time. 

• Optimization of consensus procedure and block generation  
We will apply the DPOA (Delegated Proof of Authority) to consensus algorithm. This algorithm is 

designed based on the stability and reliability of users, and improves the processing speed by simplifying 
the consensus procedure / calculation / time and optimizing the number of participants. 

2) Each blockchain (DApp) has its guarantees own independent network and governance 
Each and every blockchain should not be subordinate to a certain higher ranked blockchain. It should be its 
own independent blockchain network, governance, data, cryptocurrency, and service. The data of other 

blockchains or DApps which is not required should not be possessed, and resources should not be used to 
maintain such data. In addition, the delay of processing data and transactions on other blockchains should 
not affect your service and network.

YGGDRASH solves the problem by introducing the concept of Stem Chain and Branch Chains. To 

summarize, it can provide services without delay in using the blockchain DApp with normal users because it 
consists of a separate blockchain as an independent Branch Chain depending on the nature and purpose of 
each service. This allows the creation of an ecosystem and environment where an active DApp is operated 

and serviced in any situation.  

3) Various blockchain technology toolkits are provided for participants in YGGDRASH network 
YGGDRASH provides processing performance for each Branch Chain and various technical services to 
blockchain business participants. 

 
• Enhanced processing performance through blockchain network sharding 
• Enhanced node sync speed through Block Reassembling Algorithm (BRA) 
• Enhanced data storage through file sharing on a P2P network 
• Enhanced smart contract data storage 
• Convenient applications and enhanced efficiency of blockchain services through block chain Starter & 
Smart kits 

  

3.1.2 Solving selfish mining competition and enabling trust or reputation based  

         economic incentives 

1) Solving selfish mining competition systems 
A node (= miner) who is in charge of block consensus in the public blockchain is the most important factor for 
maintaining the blockchain network. However, the increasing number of transactions to be processed has 
resulted in selfish competitions among the nodes (= diggers) that intend to secure transactions with the 

highest fees.  

YGGDRASH will solve the selfish competition problem by applying DPOA. The verifier of a YGGDRASH 

blockchain has the authority to determine the policies of our YGGDRASH network, rather than receiving 
incentives of cryptocurrency through PoW and PoS. Therefore, the verifier will conduct selfish mining for 
economic incentives but contribute to make our network much healthier and enriching.  

2) Trust based economic incentive is guaranteed 
In YGGDRASH, a separate branch chain, the Reputation Evaluation Branch Chain, evaluates the trust level 

or reputation score of each branch chain and user. This chain is designed to measure reputation scores 
based on equitable "time". This is a resource given in the same amount to anyone equally in order to ensure 
punishment for malicious users and to provide economic incentives such as fee exemption for good users. 

3.1.3 Interoperability and scalability between block chains are guaranteed 

YGGDRASH is a blockchain platform that can connect different blockchains which satisfy different business 
needs of users. The Stem Chain and Branch Chain serve those roles. The Stem Chain contains address 

information of all Branch Chains connected to the YGGDRASH network as if using domain services when we 

�19



search on Google. In order to connect to other Branch Chains, the active Branch Chain selects the service of 

other Branch Chains needed to its business using the information contained in Stem Chain.  

A true competition-free market in YGGDRASH will finally emerge once it is possible to ensure the 

independence of each blockchain and economic incentive by connecting to other blockchain businesses.  

In the early stages, each blockchain should focus its time on making its own blockchain ecosystem and 

service as a Branch Chain. Subsequently, each blockchain will find opportunities with other blockchain 
services in our YGGDRASH ecosystem. Participants will eventually experience another level or type of 
business model that can be created through mutual connections.  

The more of these fused services with various business players there will be, the more our network will be 
enriched. Users will be fascinated by our YGGDRASH blockchain ecosystem. 

3.2 Incentives for different participants  

YGGDRASH is designed to provide economic incentives to all participants in the blockchain ecosystem. It 

aims to create a transparent, fair, and reasonable blockchain ecosystem for all network participants, rather 
than to create a monopoly environment through someone with wealth and power.  

3.2.1 Cryptocurrency developers 

DApps and services can be developed and provided along with their own business logic without having to 
take into consideration transaction delays of other blockchains. Each Branch Chain can be connected in line 
with your business strategy. Also, development resources needed to separate chain connections, such as a 

Atomic Swap, are no longer needed and various blockchain technologies and toolkits provided by 
YGGDRASH can be utilized.  

3.2.2 Cryptocurrency miners 

Branch chain miners: They can select reliable chains based on the chain reputation score information 
provided by YGGDRASH. Through that stable mining rewards can be guaranteed.  

YGGDRASH ecosystem: YGGDRASH can create a stable network ecosystem as a whole, including Branch 
Chains due to the inflow of many miners who prefer stable rewards.

3.2.3 Cryptocurrency users (investors or service users) 

They can select reliable blockchain services based on the information of the Reputation Evaluation Chain 
provided by YGGDRASH, and a stable investment rate for investors and stable service for users are 

provided. Also, users with high reputation scores can receive additional benefits such as fee exemption. 

3.2.4 Cryptocurrency service providers 

It is possible to implement one’s own service more quickly and efficiently by using the blockchain Starter & 

Smart Kit provided by YGGDRASH. Also, service providers can create continuous, expandable, and various 
fused services by connecting rich blockchain services which are connected to the YGGDRASH ecosystem.  

3.2.5 Cryptocurrency exchanges 

By using the YGGDRASH trust evaluation information it is possible to recognize and prevent users from the 
damages on exchange platforms caused by problems of a specific chain or cryptocurrency. In addition, it is 
possible to minimize the development resources needed to list cryptocurrencies by using a standardized 

wallet module. This helps to maximize revenue of exchange platforms from listing and operating their 
platform.
