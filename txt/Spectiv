Introduction
VR is growing in exposure globally and, what was initially available to a small 
group, serviced by an even smaller group of products by innovators, technocrats and 
entrepreneurs, is growing rapidly. 
For many, this is now a commercial reality. VR is expected to be the next revolutionary 
tech boom, projected to grow from US$3.7b in 2016 to US$30B+ by 2020 – making it 
one of the fastest growing industries in the world.

Spectiv offers, or will offer:
Community-Driven VR Content
Spectiv enables ordinary users to stream any personal experiences with their own  
VR equipment. This content can range from professionally produced to casually  
recorded uploads.

Commercial VR Events
VR live streams will address sporting events, concerts, and more from premium seat 
proximities for a truly engaging perspective. This enables viewers to not only watch 
popular events, but to be fully immersed in the atmosphere remotely.

Spectiv OriginalsTM
Original VR content produced by Spectiv, voted on by the community. Spectiv users  
have a say in what they want to experience.
While the Spectiv Company is the issuer of SIGs, for technical security purposes, 
each user will have complete control over the SIGs they purchase. Hence, a repeat 
of the possibility of an Equifax-style1 hack, due to the centralization of information 
management, would not be possible as each user’s account (“Wallet”) must be 
compromised individually2.
SIGs will be available for purchase on 8 December 2017.

The Problem with Advertising
Online attention is becoming one of the most valuable and sought-after assets in the 
world. As a result, entire economies have formed around the exchange of attention. At 
the most fundamental level, there are four actors in these attention markets:

Advertisers: 
Advertisers are the driving force in this market vertical; that is, they are the 
purchasers of attention.

Publishers:
Publishers are the producers of attention. By publishing quality contributions, they 
drive audiences to view their media content.

Viewers: 
The viewers are the “commodity”, providing the raw attention that advertisers value.

Curators: 
Curators are the influencers of attention and share content with their unique 
audience of engaged viewers.

It follows that advertisers should buy or reward attention by interacting directly with 
publishers, viewers and curators. However, this is not the case today. 
Advertisers pay for campaigns through centralized entities that act as attention brokers 
between advertisers and publishers (Google, Facebook etc.). This creates a barrier that 
advertisers and media publishers must funnel through to reach viewers.  As such, these 
intermediary entities control access to, and the management of, attention data related 
to an advertising campaign. This leads to the charge of substantial matchmaking fees.



SOLUTION: SIGNAL 
TOKEN PROTOCOL

Spectiv is the creator and initial adopter of the Signal Token 
protocol. This protocol decentralizes the interaction between 
advertisers, content publishers, viewers, and curators. It is open-
source and intended for other media platforms to build upon. This 
section details the token’s utility and crowdsale conditions.

CONCLUSION

Decentralizing Attention Markets
The Signal Token Protocol (“Protocol”) is designed to decentralize the buying, selling and 
rewarding of attention by removing the middleman from the equation. This is achieved 
through Ad Campaign Smart Contracts.

Ad Campaign Smart Contract 
Using the Protocol, an advertiser can use SIGs via a smart contract associated with 
target content. This content is now active, or “hot”, which means publishers, viewers, 
and curators can engage with that advertiser through the smart contract and be 
rewarded with SIGs for driving attention to that content.

Every ad view, click, and reward that occurs is communicated to the Ad Campaign 
Smart Contract through a third-party oracle. The Ad Campaign Smart Contract will then 
autonomously distribute SIGs to the users participating in that engagement.

By utilizing smart contracts, a publicly verifiable blockchain, and trusted oracles, this 
protocol can directly disintermediate the “trade” of attention.

The Protocol enables advertisers to execute ad campaigns by directly rewarding the 
producers, providers, and influencers of attention – rather than going through a broker. 
Advertisers can target their smart contract to a wide portfolio of content or even one 
specific media item. Advertisers choose the budget of their campaign by committing the 
exact number of SIGs that they want to be dispersed.

Advertisers also set custom conditions for the smart contract; e.g. .01 Sigs rewarded 
per ad click or .05 Sigs rewarded per ad click. This supports a transparent, competitive 
marketplace, where participants compete for the highest-rewarding smart contract. 
Advertisers can then visibly aim for low-cost, or appropriate and effective cost 
campaigns. This provides a reward opportunity for all participants.

An Open-Source Protocol 
The Spectiv Company developed the Signal Token Protocol specifically for use within 
Spectiv, but we understand that accurate attention data analytics is difficult to perfect. 
Additionally, we understand that for real-world advertisers to engage with SIGs, the 
protocol must accommodate more than just Spectiv content.

We have developed SIGs for any ad-driven media platform to use and build upon; 
video-based, audio-based, written-based, or mixed. In other words, the SIG’s utility is 
not fixed to Spectiv. Rather, it is built to be its own decentralized, autonomous protocol 
that can support multiple attention economies. Each media platform can integrate its 
own unique mechanisms for monitoring genuine attention data, contributing to the long-
term effectiveness of the protocol.

CONCLUSION

LEGAL

Initial Use Case: Spectiv VR
Decentralized protocols make great sense in theory, but are often faced with a fatal 
challenge when applied to the real world: early adoption. Without a dedicated early 
adopter to champion a new product, it can be extremely difficult to generate traction 
and compete with established players. 

Spectiv serves as the pioneer and first use case for the Signal Token Protocol.

Through trial ad campaigns, SIGs can be used to experiment with protocol economics 
and develop early abuse-mitigation logic using real attention data. This can provide 
a strong, welcoming foundation for other media platforms to use and build upon its 
architecture, thereby providing a protocol for the reward of attention.

The Spectiv Company’s ultimate goal is to become the foundational layer for 
connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and 
viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv.

Below we have listed the fundamental, open-source uses for Signal Tokens that will be 
implemented into the Spectiv platform:

Publishers 
When a publisher contributes VR content, they will have the option to be included in 
all Ad Campaign Smart Contracts for that particular content. To do this, a publisher 
can simply tie their SIG wallet to the content they contributed. If an advertiser runs a 
campaign on that content, the publisher will be rewarded with a percentage of SIGs for 
every view and conversion that was incurred while hosting the ad.

Viewers 
Viewers are able to get SIG rewards by directly engaging with advertisements. If a 
media platform adopts the Protocol, it can offer registered users the option to obtain SIG 
rewards. This simply ties the user’s Sig wallet to their account on the platform. When this 
viewer watches a full ad, visits a link, or makes a purchase, that information is sent to the 
relevant Ad Campaign Smart Contract. If engagement conditions are met, the contract 
distributes a fraction of SIGs to the viewer’s wallet.

Curators 
Curators can be rewarded with SIGs for sharing content with their friends and followers. 
To do this, a curator must generate a personalized Signal link URL to the content they 
wish to share. This unique URL connects the curator with the content. If the curator shares 
this link with their followers, all attention driven through the link will be tracked and 
communicated to the Ad Campaign Smart Contract. If reward conditions are met, the 
contract will distribute a portion of SIGs to the curator’s wallet.

Tips 
The community-driven user-to-user tipping system within Spectiv is one of the most 
unique features of the platform. It works on a “rapid-tap” basis, wherein viewers can 
tap a small token button on their viewing interface while engaging in a VR experience.

CONCLUSION

Tapping this button expresses a “like” for the content while also sending a miniscule tip 
to the creator. These small denomination SIG tips create a powerful interactive user 
dynamic between viewers and content creators. This is because viewers from around the 
world may be more inclined to contribute to streamers when the contribution is gamified 
and immaterial. It also means the average publisher can be rewarded based on the 
breadth of contributing viewers.
Note that this can also reduce “like” spam or act as a control for “like” farming, the intent 
of which is solely to appear as if a specific content is popular.

Premium Content 
Spectiv users will be able to use SIGs to redeem for pay-to-play VR content such as  
live event passes, VR movies, Spectiv Originals, and more. During the beta Platform, 
these sales will be executed at a discount against the USD rate if paid for in SIGs.  
This encourages publishers, viewers, curators to earn SIGs by engaging with ads, 
generating crucial early data and feedback that we will use to optimize Spectiv’s ad  
campaign economics.

Indicating Preference 
Spectiv users who hold SIGs will have the ability to show their support for particular 
content that they would like to see on the platform. These act as a feedback from 
viewers to Spectiv in relation to major content contributions (for example, which country 
might be featured for an exclusive VR walkthrough). This aspect is important to Spectiv 
as it engages the audience by giving them what they’d like to see and experience.

60% Sigs Crowdsale:
SIGs will be sold through a public crowdsale at a discount to a maximum value of 
US$40MM. Purchasers will be able to purchase SIGs through the use of a smart contract 
using the Ethereum protocol. Once the sale is over, there will be no further opportunity to 
buy SIGs at a discount from the Spectiv Company. SIGs will be distributed following the 
sale and an accounting audit process. 

20% Platform Reserve:
This will be held in reserve to primarily be used as a stimulus to run trials on the token 
protocol and establish an active ecosystem within Spectiv. These reserve tokens will be 
released slowly over the course of an extended pilot-testing period. In addition, the 
tokens will be available from direct purchases from the platform at a price to be set by 
the Spectiv Company, which shall not be less than the discounted price obtained in the 
token sale. Further guidance on this process will be elucidated in subsequent 
documentation prior to the sale of SIGs. Finally, these tokens may also be used for 
partnerships or deals that are for the betterment of the Spectiv VR platform. Examples of 
this could be using Platform Reserve tokens to acquire licenses for content, bringing on 
advisors specific to Spectiv VR, acquiring VR related technologies, etc...

13% Management Team:
These SIGs will be reserved for the company and divided among the management team. 
The management team will pay a consideration of US$10 per % point for a total of US$130.

4% Escrow and Advisors:
Escrow partners and consultants will also be able to purchase SIGs at the equivalent of 
US$10 per % point for a total of US$40. 2% of the SIGs supply will be evenly split 
amongst two escrow partners for the work in using and supporting Spectiv. The 
remaining 2% of the total SIGs will be evenly split and offered to consultants. SIGs will be 
released after a 3-month period following the end of the token sale. 

Signal Tokens Distribution
The total number of SIGs created will depend on how many are sold during the sale 
period. Once this supply is determined, SIGs will be allocated as follows:

Signal Tokens Crowdsale
SIGs will be publicly sold through a token issuance event. The issuance will open via a 
Pre-ICO which will run from December 8th, 2017 at 2:00PM (GMT -5) through December 
21st, 2017 2:00PM (GMT -5). Starting December 21st, the Pre-ICO will end and then 
the ICO will run from December 21st-29th 2:00PM (GMT -5). The number of SIGs sold 
will determine the total number of SIGs created. The public token sale will be capped 
at US$40MM. The sale will end immediately if the max cap is reached. The Spectiv 
Company will host the SIG sale at www.spectivvr.com.

Pricing 
SIGs will be valued at a fixed price of 650 Sigs/Eth each. Early crowdsale participants 
will have the opportunity to buy SIGs at a discount to this price, based on the timing 
of their purchase. SIGs will be sold through 4 levels, with each level representing an 
early bird bonus opportunity. The earlier the purchase, the greater bonus that can be 
expected. This system essentially rewards buyers in extra SIGs for showing early support 
and engagement.

Early Bird Bonuses 
The different bonus opportunities are spread across 4 levels:

Early Bird Bonuses:
Level 1: 40% Bonus (buy 1, 0.4 free) | December 8th-11th

Level 2: 25% Bonus (buy 1, 0.25 free) | December 11th - 18th

Level 3: 10% Bonus (buy 1, 0.1 free) | December 18th - 21st

Level 4: 0% Bonus (buy 1, 0 free) | December 21st - 28th

Examples 
To illustrate how this bonus schedule works, let’s say four different buyers participate in 
the crowdsale. Each buyer contributes $25 at a different level in the bonus schedule:

Level 1: Adam sends 1 ETH 
He gets 650 Sigs by default, plus an additional 40%. 
(650 x 1.40) = 910 Sigs

Level 2: Paul sends 1 ETH 
He gets 650 Sigs by default, plus an additional 25%.  
(650 x 1.25) = 812.5 Sigs

3% Bounties and Rewards:
This will be allocated as a reward to proactive purchase participants through a  
bounty campaign.

Level 3: Jane sends 1 ETH

Level 4: Bill sends 1 ETH 
He gets 650 Sigs by default, with no bonus added.  
(650 x 1.00) = 650 Sigs 

This means purchasers get significantly more SIGs for engaging with the crowd- 
sale proactively. 

How to Participate 
Purchasers will need an ETH wallet. 

Any non-exchange ETH wallet will be required to receive SIGs. This ETH wallet will 
generate a personalized ETH address. When the crowdsale launches, users will be able 
to specify how much ETH they would like to pay in return for SIGs. 

Users will then be prompted to input the unique ETH address tied to their ETH wallet – 
this is where their SIGs will be sent. After a user inputs their ETH address, they will be 
provided with the purchasing address that they can send payment to. 

Once payment has been made, users will see a receipt detailing the number of SIGs 
they purchased and bonus SIGs redeemed. SIGs will be distributed to user-provided ETH 
addresses through the smart contract 30 days following the end of the sale to account 
for the audit process.

Content Strategy
Community First 
The biggest difference between Spectiv and other VR streaming platforms is the 
community-driven focus. Spectiv is a user-integrated market of virtual reality 
experiences. In other words, Spectiv is not just a portal for viewers to watch popular VR 
events – it is an environment where users from across the world can share their real-life 
experiences with others. 

This means a viewer living in the United States can put on a VR headset and see 
through the perspective of a streamer in Italy or Japan. That streamer could be visiting a 
significant landmark that is local to them, but unique and novel to viewers thousands of 
miles away. Community-driven content could be as simple as travels and regular day-
to-day living, or as deviceful as guerilla journalism, wherein users could share real-time 
local perspectives of politically charged regions, creating an immersive news outlet. 
These are just a few examples of what is possible with community-driven content on the 
Spectiv platform.

Spectiv creates an environment for users to not only consume VR content, but to 
contribute their own and share it with others. This community- driven, user-based 
content promotes organic social growth among users. This model has proven successful 
for streaming platforms outside of the VR space and will be equally integral in building 
an active user base for VR streaming.

Initially, we plan to work with independent VR enthusiasts around the world who have 
already adopted VR recording systems. They will be the first general users to publish 
content on Spectiv, generating an immediate selection of community provided VR 
content. This content will include pre-recorded productions and live streams – essentially 
any VR experiences users want to share. Building this selection of content will be a 
primary focus for the Spectiv alpha V1 release.

Spectiv also provides an ecosystem for rewards between users, wherein viewers can 
tip streamers for content they enjoy as well as subscribe to be updated on new content 
releases. This is a core element of the person-to-person Spectiv environment because it 
enables users to be rewarded for sharing their VR experiences with the world. 

Commercial Events 
Sports, music, and other such performances were historically and naturally designed to 
be experienced in person. The thrill of these events lies in the atmosphere that surrounds 
them: the people, the energy, and the details. These real-life elements cannot be 
replicated in a modern, at-home TV viewing experience. And, unfortunately, while many 
consumers would love to experience these events in all their real-life glory, most do not 
want to spend the time or money on tickets/travel and often prefer not to leave home.
With VR technology, Spectiv makes it possible for these viewers to experience that real-
life glory from the comfort of their living room. With the use of cutting-edge, HD 360° 
broadcasting technology, we will be able to live stream an event from the view of a 
premium seat, on site. This means that when viewing these events from home with a VR 
headset, viewers will virtually be in that seat.

As live event viewership grows, we will offer different perspectives from within each 
event depending on user feedback. For example, while watching a concert, users might 
have the choice to enjoy it from front row for a more intimate experience, deep in the 
crowd for a more atmospheric experience, or even moving around for a more well-
rounded, complete perspective.

User Feedback Driven Content 
Once the commercial and community-driven content channels are established and 
standardized, Spectiv will start contributing its own original VR content. We will pursue 
original projects based on user feedback. 

Our mission for this content is to give VR participants a voice for what they want to see. 
This content could include live VR journalism, documentaries, real-time tours, or even 
movies wherein users can watch from the perspective of a character in the story. Most 
of these Spectiv OriginalsTM will involve partnership with an organization mutually 
interested in creating a VR project. 

For example, if the state of Hawaii wanted to produce a VR tour of the islands to attract 
tourism, we could work together to create a truly immersive perspective for the world to 
see. Or if a director wanted to create a VR documentary on the deep-sea creatures of 
the Pacific Ocean, we could accommodate the tools and expertise necessary to make 
a quality production. Most importantly, we want to present all options to the community 
and give viewers what they want. Original content will not be introduced until Spectiv 
has a self-sustaining user base, robust user-to-user streaming environment, and live 
commercial broadcasting channels. 

Users & Participants
Advertisers: those who wish to advertise on Publisher’s contents or by creating new 
advertising content of their own.  

Publishers: all users who upload VR content, live or pre-produced. This content can 
range from experiences as novel as skydiving to activities as simple as grocery shopping. 
One of our initial objectives is to build an immediate selection of global VR experiences 
for viewers to choose from. As such, we will implement incentives for users to upload 
content from their uniquely local regions to quickly build a global portfolio of VR content 
on the platform. And with the rapid commercialization of consumer-level VR recording 
technology, Spectiv’s VR content selection should grow organically alongside that of  
the industry. 

Viewers: consuming the VR content on Spectiv. They are the most important element  
of Spectiv. There are two main objectives that must be achieved to offer viewers the 
best experience possible. First and foremost, the Spectiv Company is to make it a priority 
to offer a very wide range of VR experiences to choose from. This includes officially 
licensed live events, global user-driven contributions, and eventually Spectiv Original VR 
productions. Second, we will make the viewer interface simple, intuitive,  
and unintimidating.

Curators: users who share VR content with their friends and followers. They play a 
critical role as attention influencers for online media and will play an especially big role 
in driving users to Spectiv content. As a streaming platform, it is important that users are 
compelled to share their experiences.

More on Curators 
There is an overwhelming surplus of quality content on the Internet. In the attention 
market, curators provide value to attention payers by filtering through and 
consolidating content uniquely catered to their following. This is done by generating 
signals through likes, retweets, shares, etc. Today, followers are paying most of their 
attention to these signals rather than to the actual content creators. This creates 
an intermediary layer between content creators and their viewers, where a content 
creator’s ability to connect to viewers is no longer just based on the quality of their 
content, but also on how effectively their content is shared over the Internet. Thus, 
curators play a critical role in influencing the content’s overall viewership. 

This new intermediary role does not present a problem in mainstream content 
mediums like music, video, news, etc. This is because these mediums have already 
been critically adopted on a large scale, such that there are more than enough 
curators to spread the content. In other words, this layer acts fluidly as a channel to 
ensure quality content gets the exposure it deserves. 

However, this layer creates a degree of friction for an emerging content format; if 
curators have not adopted the new content medium, they will not send out signals to 
their followers. And since viewers are rewarded for their attention almost exclusively 
on these signals, they most likely will not be exposed to the content. 

To accelerate mainstream VR adoption, we must deliberately penetrate this dynamic. 
We plan to do this by capitalizing on the influence of existing content curators to 
reach a critical mass of attention payers. Using Sigs, we are creating a decentralized 
economic incentive for curators to generate signals to VR content and ultimately 
promote mainstream VR adoption.

Licensed Partners: partners from which we aim to license rights to broadcast mainstream 
events like sports and concerts. The Spectiv Company has spoken to broadcasting 
representatives from popular commercial organizations and they have all confirmed that 
viewership is the most critical element to reaching an agreement. As such, our strategy 
is to build our initial user base through community-driven content and then present this 
user base to relevant organizations. Once our viewership satisfies an organization’s 
requirements, we can begin the licensing process. Certain broadcasting partnerships will 
be non-exclusive.

VR Market Outlook

estimated at US$3.7b and is expected to reach US$40.4b in 2020. Next year, this is

predicted to reach US$12.1b. However, this estimate involves the sales of hardware as 
well.  By contrast, the  VR software market in 2016 was US$0.6b. 

Nonetheless, the advertising industry still needs to adapt to the delivery of content via 
VR. We estimate that this should be directly proportional to the growth of VR software 
(and content). The addressable market size for Spectiv is therefore hard to estimate, 
especially considering the rapid growth of that industry vertical.  The creation of VR 
advertising or embedded advertising in VR content also depends on the effectiveness of 
this delivery to users, which the Spectiv Company is optimistic about, although that still 
has yet to be properly quantified. 

Further, adding the element of the blockchain and cryptocurrency community in the mix 
may also accelerate adoption of VR due to users from the digital currency (or token) 
ecosystem pre-purchasing SIGs for use or redemption on Spectiv. 

Market Growth 
The growth of the VR market is undeniable. With companies like Intel, Samsung, Google 
and Facebook working on providing medium of interaction for VR and Youtube amongst 
others providing VR content, these efforts may add significantly to the growth profile of 
this industry.    

Moreover, Bloomberg reports that there are at least 200 startups working in China’s VR 
industry5. In relation to hardware, “the best-selling unit seems to be the Ritech headset… 
selling just over 100,000 units per month.”6 The growth of headsets should drive the 
demand for more VR content. 

Competitive Landscape 
Competitors 
Today, several large organizations have, or are creating, VR platforms to experience VR 
content from home, such as NBA VR, Netflix VR, Google’s Daydream, HBO GO VR and 
YouTube VR to name a few. This is an extension of their current media delivery platforms, 
governed by the same traditional structure. However, they can source from their existing 
user base to provide these experiences much faster and easier than new entrants. The 
latter need to generate traction, race against time, offer a different value proposition by 
competing with these platforms or onboard a new demographic before they do. 

Differentiation 
Spectiv has several points of differentiation with the traditional models.

Traction sales and support: 
Spectiv can deviate from the use traditional channels of organic growth or sales. 
By pre-selling SIGs7, which are used as a platform credit, the strategy is to achieve

site. This should not be confused with the “pre-sale” terminology used in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which generally relate to the period 
prior to a public sale of tokens or coins.

traction quickly from supporters globally. They may turn into advocates of Spectiv 
choosing to support the growth of content, advertising, and viewership and act as 
a mouth-piece for Spectiv. Hence, the commercialization aspect of the business is 
achieved at the end of the SIG sale. This can then quickly make Spectiv a viable 
competitor to other platforms that are achieving VR traction organically or from a 
current user base. 

Security and overheads: 
By adopting a user-controlled wallet, the ability to introduce a systemic security 
risk is greatly reduced. Any reward transactions (transfers) for activities on the 
platform amongst users can be done from one user controlled wallet to another. This 
reduces the computation intensity from Spectiv as this is handled by smart contract 
transactions on the [Ethereum] blockchain.    

Smart Contracts: 
By integrating the front-end Spectiv platform with a smart contracts backbone, 
all transactions are still available to users independently of whether or not Spectiv 
experiences technical issues. 

New Possibilities: 
The results of points 1 through 3 above, is that new possibilities are created by 
streamlining the process of connecting advertisers, publishers, curators and viewers 
in a frictionless manner.  This means that they have more control over their activities 
without an intermediary broker in between.

Preface
Additional Documentations 
This General Business Document (“GBD”) is one of two documents that make up the full 
sale documentation to prospective purchasers. The other document is the token product 
disclosure statement (“TPDS”) containing the relevant detailed particulars of importance 
for the prospective purchasers.

This GBD contains some elements overlapping with the content of the TPDS. The TPDS 
is a more focused document specifically detailing token mechanism and risk analysis for 
those wanting to know more about the token sale process.

Presales 
Spectiv conducted its first presale during the end of August. The purchase amount 
received was performed pursuant to a Know Your Customer (“KYC”) process and audited 
by the global accounting affiliate firm Baker Tilly (Mauritius). The summary audit letter is 
attached in the Notes section to this document. During this process the amount of ETH, 
BTC, and USD received were as follows:

Eth - 3547.66

BTC - 31.58

USD - $57,922.50

Governance of Token Sales Revenue 
Participants should be confident that payments made for SIGs are directly attributed to 
benefits on the platform and the provision of better and more exciting experiences. With 
that said, we have established assurances and transparency policies that will directly 
govern the revenues received through the token sale.

Spectiv LTD (Mauritius) 
Spectiv LTD acts as the issuing entity for tokens for purchasers, except residents of 
the USA. Spectiv LTD shall be an entity focused and responsible for the community 
management and the administration efforts to ensure supporters’ voices are heard.  

Spectiv LLC (USA) 
Spectiv LLC acts as the issuing entity for tokens for purchasers from the USA that meet 
the classification of “accredited Investors” under the Securities Act of 1933. Spectiv 
LLC shall be the operational headquarters for the Spectiv Company. 

Spectiv LLC will be responsible to produce the relevant software component of the 
platform (and under an understanding between Spectiv LTD (Mauritius) it will also be 
responsible to produce the smart contract component that addresses issuance for 
the Mauritian entity). It will also manage the operational components of the global 
business of the Spectiv Company.

Escrow
Participants should be confident that payments made for SIGs are directly attributed to 
benefits on the platform and the provision of better and more exciting experiences. With 
that said, the Spectiv Company has established assurances and transparent policies that 
will directly govern the revenues received through the token sale. 

Spectiv’s first level of token sale security will come from the smart contract itself. The 
second level of security is via multi-signature for the release of revenues.  At the most 
fundamental level, we are implementing an escrow that will oversee the release of 
revenues – all revenues will be controlled by 3 independent actors, as follows:

1. CoinVault ATM CEO, Sheldon Weisfeld

2. Sutton Stone LTD

3. Spectiv LLC

Revenues received through sale will be locked in an escrow wallet until the Spectiv 
Company’s audit process has been successfully completed and distributed to all purchasers. 
Once SIGs have been distributed, escrow actors will be able to approve the release of 
token revenues to USD where they will be held in either Spectiv LTD or Spectiv LLC. 

The receipt of moneys in Spectiv LTD shall be used to account for Spectiv’s Mauritian 
team and the rest transferred to Spectiv’s LLC account evenly over two separate 
disbursements, contingent on the achievement of predetermined milestones tied to the 
benefit of the community. 

The disbursement schedule is outlined here:

1. 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred immediately following the distribution of SIGs 
purchased through sale for payment of the smart contract build for the token sale 
process. This will be used to cover long-term development and updates for the Signal 
Token protocol. These revenues will also support development for the Spectiv platform 
– specifically in driving exciting, high-quality VR content to the site. A minor allocation 
will be used to support general business operations and infrastructure setup for the 
company. 

2. 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred upon launch of the beta platform. These revenues 
will be used to fuel the next stage of token development and expansion. This will 
include bringing in other media platforms to build attention economies on the Signal 
Token protocol using Spectiv’s use-case data. Additionally, these revenues will 
be used to optimize the Spectiv platform, build a user base, and reach licensing 
agreements with mainstream organizations to broadcast popular events. These 
revenues, amongst other things, shall be used to support the long-term business 
operations for Spectiv, including development and platform maintenance expenses. 

3. 1/3 of revenues shall be retained in the Mauritian entity to be used for content 
production, administration of the community, global events and the like.

The above may change depending on operational demands and taxes.

Use of Funds

40% Token/Platform: 
These revenues will be used to develop the Signal Token protocol and Spectiv. This 
includes hiring additional full-time developers, collaborating with other media platforms 
to build on the Signal Token protocol, and supporting operations for Spectiv. Generally, 
these revenues are earmarked to compensate all personnel and partners involved in 
technical development.

15% Marketing & Sales: 
These revenues will be used to raise brand awareness and drive new users to the 
platform. We plan to begin with a very targeted online marketing campaign aimed at 
reaching users who have had some exposure to VR. Our objective in marketing is not to 
educate people on the possibilities of VR – the industry is going to do that on its own. 
Our objective is to take these people who are slowly being exposed to it, and present 
them with a simple, welcoming destination for VR experiences. This gives novice VR users 
a dedicated but unintimidating platform to get started with. Revenues allocated for 
marketing and sales will specifically go toward customer acquisition/referral campaigns 
that help us reach this segment of users.

15% Content Licenses: 
This percentage of revenues will be set aside for broadcast licensing deals with major 
organizations. The prices of these licenses vary significantly depending on the 
organizations and events. These licenses will help attract organic viewership from 
outside the VR space in a major way.

10% Payouts for Contributors: 
A percentage of revenues will be used to promote immediate content contributions. We 
will directly pay existing VR enthusiasts from around the world to upload unique VR content 
to the platform. We will also sponsor existing influencers from other streaming platforms to 
contribute their content to Spectiv in VR. It is important that we allocate revenue to these 
efforts because this initial content directly effects early platform engagement.

8% Equipment: 
These revenues will be used to acquire VR assets. This will include the setups used  
to broadcast live commercial events and camera rigs used to record original and  
partnered content.

7% General & Administrative: 
For day-to-day overhead expenses; rent, utilities, travel, etc.

5% Legal Fees: 
5% of revenue or at least $200,000 will be set-aside in reserve for legal contingencies.

Platform Rewarded
Content creators: 
They will be able to receive tips and access subscriptions through Spectiv. Moreover, 
these users will be able to earn SIGs through ad campaign smart contracts. Verified 
content creators holding SIGs will be able to deal with SIGs at their absolute discretion 
since they are the custodians of those tokens. These users will have a smooth and robust 
dashboard to account for collections. Content Creators will have a seamless experience 
whether or not they are familiar with blockchain or cryptocurrencies. We may offer 
content creators the ability to go through a basic verification process in order to qualify 
for conversion to USD. 

Appcoin:  
They will be allowed to redeem SIGs for premium VR content, monthly memberships, 
or to tip/subscribe to their favorite content contributors. The Spectiv Company aims 
to implement a new user sign-up campaign that will credit $3 in SIGs and send a 
complimentary phone-compatible cardboard VR headset to a limited number of new 
users who sign up to Spectiv. Our objective is to give viewers an immediate experience 
with the gamified tipping process as well as a basic means to begin enjoying VR  
content instantly. 

Curators: 
To engage with an ad campaign, curators must deploy Sigs through a specific video 
they would like to share. This action generates a unique URL for that video which is 
directly associated to the curator. All attention driven through this link is monitored and 
analyzed to track ad engagement levels (views/clicks/sales/etc.). This attention data 
communicates with the smart contract, which then releases SIGs to the curator through 
if-then triggers; if “x” traffic is driven through the link, then the curator receives “y” SIGs

Curators will be incentivized to share the best quality VR content that they consider most 
relevant to their specific followership, so as to maintain follower interest (just like with any 
other content they signal). This means that attention seekers will be exposed to tailored 
VR content, more likely to pique their interest.

Broadcasting: 
Revenue models for these licensed partners will vary depending on the nature of the 
broadcasting agreement. Oftentimes organizations will have a network that users must 
subscribe to for content access, and sometimes they will operate on a pay-per-view 
basis. Spectiv will facilitate both revenue models and also adapt to other more  
nuanced arrangements. 

Spectiv may also implement and oversee on-site VR broadcasting systems to ensure 
viewers the greatest possible streaming quality and experience. Spectiv will uphold 
the highest standard of service for viewers and as such openly welcomes all quality 
assurances from the organizations we represent.

Features
Community Driven VR  
Spectiv enables ordinary users to stream any personal experiences with their own  
VR equipment. This content can range from professionally produced to casually  
recorded uploads.

Commercial VR Events 
VR live streams will address sporting events, concerts, and more from premium seat 
proximities for a truly engaging perspective. This enables viewers to not only watch 
popular events, but to be fully immersed in the atmosphere remotely.

Spectiv OriginalsTM 
Original VR content produced by Spectiv, voted on by the community. Spectiv users have 
a say in what they want to experience.

The Players
Advertisers 
Advertisers are the driving force in this market vertical; that is, they are the purchasers  
of attention.

Publishers 
Publishers are the producers of attention. By publishing quality contributions, they drive 
audiences to view their media content.

Viewers 
The viewers are the “commodity”, providing the raw attention that advertisers value.

Curators 
Curators are the influencers of attention and share content with their unique audience of 
engaged viewers.

The Spectiv Approach
The VR industry is in a period of significant growth. With its token sale, Spectiv aims to 
commercialize the business of VR content dissemination. Spectiv uses a smart contract 
architecture that allows users to be the custodian of their tokens. This reduces the impact 
of security breaches of the Spectiv platform. It also allows Spectiv users to engage with 
the relevant persons via the Spectiv platform. 

The Spectiv Company’s ultimate goal is to become the foundational layer for 
connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and 
viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv.

Additional Notes: Tokenization Issuance Model 
As the cryptocurrency field is new and often abused, we appreciate the fact that 
transparency is important and that there is a need to protect our users. For this reason, 
we have done the utmost to self-regulate in the absence of regulatory clarity; and 
distinguish ourselves from the significant amounts of noise and misleading actors in the 
space.   

Some may consider this overkill, but the Spectiv Company believes in going beyond 
what is generally seen in the industry and setting a standard for transparency and 
accountability. Further, the Spectiv Company believes in the cryptocurrency and 
blockchain industry and is there to help it along in a manner that strengthens it while 
weeding out those that are only interested in abusing it.  

Corporate SIG Issuance Structure 
The Spectiv Company aims to have two teams at opposite sides of the world, one in 
the Republic of Mauritius and the other in the USA. This will allow Spectiv Company 
the ability to work on a 24-hour rotation cycle as we are conscious of the fact that the 
blockchain and cryptocurrency world never sleeps and is a global phenomenon. 

In addition, a Regulatory Sandbox License is being sought under the Mauritian Sandbox 
Regulatory Scheme for the issuance of SIGs to all purchasers, except residents of the 
United States of America. The structure of the sale is as follows:

To citizens, residents of the United States of America  
For persons living in the United States, Spectiv LLC will only sell to purchasers that 
have met the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC’s) accredited investor status 
pursuant to Rule 501of Regulation D of the Securities Act 1933. 

Although Spectiv LLC is not issuing securities (SIGs are utilitarian and to be used 
within Spectiv and other similar platforms), it seeks to ensure that those purchasing 
SIGs are deemed to have a level of comfort in making token purchases using 
the test that the US authorities prescribed for the identification of what it deems 
“sophisticated” persons. 

For this, the Spectiv Company chose the SEC’s definition of “accredited investors”. 
The Spectiv Company is respectful of this classification although it has some 
ideological differences with the foundational basis for the same. 

Further, Spectiv LLC does not wish to introduce non-sophisticated persons to this 
young industry, if there is a risk that it leads them to purchase other tokens because 
of the hype of significant returns surrounding the Initial Coin Offerings (“ICO”) 
movement. 

Spectiv LLC understands that this may be a temporary situation before clarity and 
guidance is obtained from the US authorities, but for now with the current state of 
affairs with ICOs, it prefers to accept a “classification” of US persons, which seems 
acceptable to US authorities, and therefore its residents.  

To everyone else, except the United States of America
