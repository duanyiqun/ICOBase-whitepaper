SUMMARY



Summary

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Summary

This White Paper is the single legal document presented to the 

public in connection with the Initial Coin Offering of GIFcoin.

The GIF in GIFcoin stands for Gambling Investment Fund. This fund 

is backed by an already functioning betting website – 

VitalBet.com.

Our aim is not to convince you that we are crafting something 

genius, like many ICOs declare. In fact, unlike the majority of other 

ICO campaigns, we already have a real working project.

The idea of GIFcoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is to raise capital, 

which we'll use to upgrade VitalBet's gambling platform, as well 

as popularize and promote the VitalBet Brand on the most 

promising betting markets (countries). After we have completed 

all these steps, we expect a large increase in VitalBet's clients. As 

a result, we will share 80% of VitalBet's net profits with our GIFcoin 

token holders on a yearly basis. As simple as that.

Buying GIF Tokens from our ICO will enable Investors to 

participate in an existing and moneymaking business that is at 

the beginning of a long-term, sustainable growth.

OUR STORY



Our Story

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Our Story

It all started back in 2011 when we formed a small team, 

consisting of a web designer, an SEO master, a PPC expert, and a 

programmer. Instead of creating a studio for web design and 

marketing, we decided to begin with our own projects related to 

affiliate marketing.

Starting with an Amazon affiliate, we went through pills affiliate 

programs, software affiliates, as well as other affiliate programs, 

but we were not satisfied with the results.

After a profound analysis of the affiliate market, we found out that 

the most profitable affiliate programs are the ones for betting 

and gambling. 

For that reason, we decided to create betting and casino 

catalogs in which to present bookmakers and gambling websites.

We started in our own country – Bulgaria – with several betting 

and casino catalogs. By the end of the third month, we had 

already surpassed the revenue we had from the already 

established Amazon affiliate websites. This made us realize that 

we need to focus all our efforts and capital into the betting niche.

Six months afterward, we decided to enter the U.K. market – 
again with betting affiliate catalogs. Month after month, we 

increased not only the number of catalogs but also the number 

of countries, which we entered, as well as expanded our business 

and profits.

Our Story

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Our Story

In 2014, we were already very satisfied with what we had achieved 

– both in terms of profits and knowledge. One evening, we had a

team meeting where we started analyzing how much money

bookmakers make. On the basis of what we had been earning as

betting affiliate marketers, we came to the conclusion that being

an owner of a bookie was something very profitable and

powerful.

We decided to do further research on how much capital we shall 

need to create our own betting site, how much operating money 

we need for paying players' profits, etc.

After deep research and analysis of the market competition
among betting websites, by the end of 2014, we had enlisted the 
top companies which create fully-functioning platforms for 

betting websites, with all the necessary extras and functionalities. 

We sent inquiries, compared the offers, and chose the best offer 
not only in terms of price but also in terms of customer support.

The help of the company we chose was amazing. They explained 

to us how much operating money we need, what are the best 

channels for marketing and advertising, as well as how to 

gradually improve the attractiveness of a bookmaker's affiliate 

program. They told us where to get licenses from. They also 

provided us with invaluable advice and today, they are still 

helping us.

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Our Story

The first month of our betting website – VitalBet.com – was quite 

challenging. We didn't have a lot of clients despite that we had 

put banners on our betting catalogs at key positions. However, 

after a short research, we realized our mistakes and thanks to the 

company which created our betting site, we built the appropriate 

strategy for advertising, branding, and targeting. Things started to 

happen in the next few months, and they were happening quite 

fast. At the beginning of the fourth month, we had already 

gathered over 5,000 active users-clients, which motivated us very 

much, especially after the first month of disappointment.

In the beginning of 2017, we started to notice the large expansion 

of cryptocurrencies so we decided to add Bitcoin to our site. Since 

then, our players can use the most popular cryptocurrency not 

only as a payment method (deposit & withdrawal) but also to 

bet with it. This Bitcoin implementation further motivated our chief 

programmer to start researching and studying Blockchain 

technology and dig deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies.

In the middle of 2017, he shared with our team that thanks to the 

cryptocurrency Ethereum and their Smart Contracts, we can 

create an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) with which to collect capital 

to further improve and upgrade our brand VitalBet. The capital 

which we gather will be used for aggressive marketing and 

advertising campaigns to increase the user base, which will lead 

to an increase in profits.

Our Story

After a profound research and analysis of the ICO market, in 

November 2017, we decided to release an ICO and share our idea 

with you. With your support and trust, and with our knowledge 

and know-how, we believe we can achieve our aim to enter the 

TOP 15 bookmakers worldwide, which will bring gigantic profits to 
both you and us. According to our research and analysis, each of 

the TOP 15 bookmakers in the world generates a yearly revenue 
of $800+ million…

OVERVIEW

GIFcoin Whitepaper

VITALBET   – Betting Site Overview

We believe that life should be a fun and exciting experience, and 

we love sports. For this reason, our team puts substantial efforts 

into crafting a truly unique online betting experience.

Our core product is the very pleasure of online gambling at any 

time and in any place in the world. Briefly, we produce modern IT 

solutions to allow people to bet online on sports events and on 

their favorite gambling games. Our aim is to turn betting into a 

simple, safe, and accessible activity for every user. 

VitalBet is a fully-operational, online betting website. Following 

significant efforts, invested in marketing research, programming, 

and technology research, we launched www.VitalBet.com in 
mid-2015, covering all major sports for online betting, as well as 
casino, eSports, and virtual sports.

VITALBET   – Betting Site Overview

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Benefits

What makes us really stand out from the grand majority of other 

bookies is the fact that we offer cryptocurrency payments with 

Bitcoin – both for betting and payments (deposits and 

withdrawals). 

ONLY a few out of the TOP 100 bookmakers provide this option at 

the moment. Additionally, thanks to the funding through the ICO, 

we will add all major cryptocurrencies as betting options and 

payment methods, which will make us really stand out in the 

online betting industry.

In addition, besides digital currency payments and betting 

options, you will also get extras, such as:

Ÿ Sports Events Wagers

Ÿ IN-Play Bets

Ÿ Casino

Ÿ Live Casino

Ÿ eSports

Ÿ Virtual sports

Ÿ Livestreaming (coming soon)

GIFcoin Whitepaper

Usage

We covered all popular fiat payment methods in the industry 

(Debit/Credit Cards – VISA and MasterCard – and E-wallets – 

Skrill, Sofort, Paysafecard, etc.), and we also added the most 

popular cryptocurrency – Bitcoin.

Our plan is to attract more bettors by allowing them to use major 

cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple 

(XRP), Dash (DASH), and more. 

By doing so, we will not only broaden our client reach but also 

contribute to developing cryptocurrencies as an instrument for 

payments and betting. As expected, this new feature will use 

Blockchain technology to guarantee maximum security for every 

user, and make the gambling experience even more exciting.

Page 15

Simplicity

Very often, betting websites have a complicated design, which 

burdens users. Our plan is to make the most attractive, 

minimalistic design ever created. On our innovative platform, the 

user will see and use only the functions which really contribute to 

enjoyable betting.

The Gambling and Sports Betting Market

These high revenue shares are due to the superior bets in the 

market in comparison with the wagers placed via lotteries and in 

casinos, as well as owing to the increasing authorization and 

legalization of sports betting online, allowing users to place bets 

from any corner of the globe.

With an ever-expanding internet-using population and a growing 

legalization of online sports betting in numerous countries, 

counting the U.S.A., this market segment will experience a 

substantial growth in the upcoming years.

Market Overview

GIFcoin Whitepaper

The Gambling and Sports Betting Market

The following features typically characterize the global online 

sports betting market:

Large   market   size and top phase of growth.

Seasonality of most sports - high season during world sports 

events (FIFA World Cup, for instance) or low season during the 

summer.

Big initial  costs for entering new markets, mainly owing 
to expensive licensing and costly promotion campaigns.

The large market share is attributed to a limited number of sports, 

such as soccer, horse racing, basketball, cricket, and greyhound 

racing.

Illegal nature of sports betting in a number of Asian countries , 

including the enormous markets of China, India, Hong Kong, and 

South Korea; the entire market of sports betting is $1.5+ trillion, out 

of which legal betting (check the figure above) represents less 

than 20% of the total revenue.

Market Overview

Competition

Page 23

We acknowledge the extremely high level of competition in online 

gambling, as well as the presence of many powerful, 

multinational bookmakers.

Currently, VitalBet is in the TOP 100 bookies (71st place), 

according to Alexa betting sites traffic ranking.

However, we believe that thanks to capital raised from the ICO, 

we will be able to enter the TOP 15 bookmakers in the world by 
2020. 

We will overtake our competitors by providing the world's most 

efficient platform for online betting, in addition to the other 

cutting-edge advantages discussed in our Roadmap below.



ROADMAP



Roadmap

The 11 Steps to Our Mutual Success

Page 25

After the ICO has successfully ended, our Legal Department 
will create a new joint-stock company to guarantee your 
rights to shares from the new company. VitalBet will be part of 
this new company.

After the success of the ICO campaign, we will be able to 
expand the Team with New, Highly-skilled Professionals, which 
will help us for the quick growth and development of the 
project.

We'll immediately start working on the New Design of the
website, which will help us to better entertain the current and 
new customers with the best user-friendly experience.

After we finish and release the new design, we will create the
smartest and most innovative Mobile App in the betting 
industry, which will help us to engage with many new users.

Entire new update of the Affiliate Program – with the most 
attractive promotions and commissions in the betting 
industry.

We will add all popular Cryptocurrencies as Betting Options 
and Payment Methods (deposits and withdrawals), which will 
make us stand out from the competition in the gambling 
niche.

Roadmap

GIFcoin Whitepaper

The 11 Steps of Our Mutual Success

Page 26

After we successfully enhance and upgrade our betting 
platform, it will be time to further popularize and establish the 
Brand VitalBet, using the most sophisticated marketing 
campaign techniques.

Parallel to the marketing campaign, we will start an Advertising 
Campaign in strictly targeted channels used ONLY for the 
promotion of betting platforms and gambling companies.

We will apply for Licenses in the most attractive countries, which 
have strict requirements and regulations, so that we can freely 
and legally operate on their already developed markets.

After accomplishing all previous goals, we will release another 
major update - VitalBet v.2.0 - with many new extras and 
functionalities, which will make the website one of the most 
appealing to gamblers worldwide.

When we start the initial waves of the marketing and advertising 
campaigns, we expect the users to grow exponentially at a very 
rapid pace. Our expectations are to reach 100% user growth in 
the first month, and 500% in the first six months.

Initial Coin Offering (ICO) – GIFCOIN

Page 28

To grow quickly and outpace the competition, VitalBet needs 
initial capital for new design and functionality, launching of a 
mobile app, country market expansion, as well as marketing and 
advertising campaigns.

Collecting capital through the two traditional financing methods - 

debt and equity - seem to be expensive, time-consuming, or 

extremely risky.

By using an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as an alternative 

instrument for financing, we intend to gather funds in a faster and 

in a much less risky way. The raised funds will serve exclusively for 

the realization of our plans (see the Roadmap section above).

To reward our ICO Investors, we are going to share 80% of 

VitalBet's annual net profits with them once a year.

FUTURE PROFITS
BY 2020

GIFcoin Whitepaper

VITALBET – Expected Future Profits by 2020

Our aim by 2020 is to enter the ranks of the TOP 15 world betting 
sites, which use FIAT currencies, and the TOP 3 world 
cryptocurrency betting sites.

From the 300,000,000 users who will practice betting, using fiat 
money, in 2020, our target will be 0,6%, which is 1,800,000.

From the 5,000,000 users who will practice betting, using 
cryptocurrencies, in 2020, our target will be 10 %, which is 500,000.
The grand total will be 2,300,000 users.

According to unofficial data, 90% of gamblers lose their bets.

We aim at gathering 2,300,000 players by 2020. Out of them, 
around 2,100,000 will be active annually.

From our experience, each of them loses around $360 per year, or 
approximately $30 per month. 2,100,000 players x $360 lost 
wagers equals $756,000,000 losses, which will be our revenues.

VITALBET – Expected Future Profits by 2020

Out of these $756,000,000 revenue, we will have:

Ÿ 10% management costs

Ÿ 10% profits paid to gamblers

Ÿ 15% paid to our partners from the affiliate program

Ÿ 20% advertising and marketing costs

Ÿ 45% net profits
 

The net profits of 45% amount to $340,200,000. Out of these 
$340,200,000, we will share 80%, which is $272,160,000.

These $272,160,000 will be distributed annually between the 
300,000,000 tokens as a profit share. In this way, every owner of 1 
GIFCOIN token will receive an annual profit share, amounting to 
$0.9072.

Let’s say Joshua has 10,000 GIFCOIN tokens. He will have an 
annual profit share of $9,072 which will be paid in ETH in his 
Ethereum wallet once a year.
