White Paper
January 25th, 2018



Refereum provides referrals on the blockchain, built for the game industry.

Refereum is the first referral marketplace for games. The RFR token rewards 
gamers for their engagement and purchases with full transparency.  Over 150,000 
gamers have joined the platform in the two months since launch, and the number of 
gamers continues to grow exponentially.

The Refereum solution can be extended easily into other verticals. Our team 
is made up of veteran game industry experts and world-renowned blockchain 
specialists.

White Paper 



The Problem

Referral marketing is the most effective conversion tool to acquire new 
customers, but untrustworthy actors and expensive micro-payments have 
blocked its ability to scale. This is nowhere more apparent than in the gaming 
industry.

The video games industry is $109B and growing at 6% annually.

 In recent years, the number of gamers has exploded -- today, 2.2B people play 
games, making it the single most popular digital entertainment content on any 
device. 1 2   

Inevitably, social platforms like YouTube and Twitch have created strong gaming 
communities, and influencers and streamers now command promotional power 
and unprecedented reach. The top 10 influencers have an audience of 242m, double 
that of the recent Superbowl audience.

Gaming is now a booming professional sport (i.e. “eSports”) with the highest growth 
in the industry.  International “supergamer” competitions can fill stadiums that rival 
those that host traditional premier sporting events.  The 2016 International Dota 2 
Championship, the richest eSports tournament had a prize of $21m, double that of 
The Masters.  Professional gamers are fundamentally changing the market dynamics 
by bridging the private gaming world and the public sporting arena.

Executive Summary

3

Marketing is critical to drive customer acquisition and usage, but costs are 
skyrocketing.

The gaming industry spends approximately $20B in advertising and marketing 4  and 
these costs are increasing fast.  

Competition among game developers is intense. Blockbuster game developers now 
spend 2-3x the development cost for marketing and advertising through traditional 
channels to create “buzz” for their games. 5  At the same time, online customer 
acquisition costs are also rising.  

A few dominant platforms capture the majority of advertising dollars and broadly, 
an average of 30% of developer revenues in distribution fees.  



Referral marketing, a way to promote products through word-of-mouth, is 
a powerful channel and the most effective conversion tool. 

Compared to other marketing channels, referred consumers have the best 
conversion to purchase, longer retention, and a higher lifetime value.  

Referral through friends is the single most trusted form of advertising, 6  people are 
4x more likely to buy when referred by a friend, 7  and the Lifetime Value of new 
customers via referrals is 16% higher than those that are not referred. 8  Gamers, 
more than in any other entertainment medium, place an even higher trust on 
referrals, as the community is especially tight-knit and highly opinionated.   

Despite proven effectiveness, referral programs are difficult to track and 
compensate.

These campaigns suffer from fraud (e.g. fake influencer accounts, clickbots), 
reporting disparities between developers and platforms, leading to a loss of revenue 
for influencers, and many expensive intermediaries.

While industry giants can amplify a brand’s message through sharing, even they lack 
a mechanism to track the conversion funnel fully, from initial awareness all the way 
to a purchase.  

Influencers are powerful agents of referral marketing. But again, no technical 
mechanism exists to track and pay an individual conversion for each view, like, share, 
or recommendation into a direct sale.  The current approach requires developers to 
identify influencers manually, cold-contact them one by one, and negotiate unique 
deal terms, generally in the form of sponsorships.

The process is time-consuming, costly, nebulous, and lacks measurable goals.  
Moreover, it is nearly impossible to reward players with fiat currency because 
of cross-border banking complexities and geopolitical restrictions.  As a result, 
influencers and engaged fans are not compensated accordingly.

 Refereum Solution

Refereum resolves these problems around referral marketing in the video 
game industry.  

Smart contracts established directly between developers and gamers create a 
decentralized, secure, and transparent marketplace with a record of purchases and 
referrals written into the Blockchain.

Our solution eliminates fraud, layers of middlemen, various onerous fees, and 
redistributes marketing budgets to gamers and influencers instead. Our solution 
transfers value from ad agencies and other intermediaries to influencers and gamers 
directly.

Game developers can purchase RFR tokens to reward influencers and players 
for specific actions; in turn, gamers can buy or earn tokens for their actions (e.g. 
streaming a new game), which can then be used to purchase more games or 
converted to cash.  This active engagement between developers and gamers 
enables a continuous feedback loop, driving network effects and exponential 
growth.

Refereum allows anyone to participate without requiring a bank account.  We are 
also an official partner of the Connext API, which allows average consumers to 
purchase RFR tokens securely with conventional payment methods like credit cards.  

Refereum benefits all participants in the ecosystem:  

• Developers can improve their marketing campaigns.  They no longer have 
to pay huge upfront fees for campaigns that do not provide strong ROIs.  They 
can reward individuals directly, after a successful purchase.  The blockchain 
solution removes fraud and legal paperwork to reward not only for the purchase, 
but also a variety of call-to-actions.  It enables microtransactions of $0.0001 for 
completing a tutorial to $1m for winning an eSports tournament.  

• Influencers can monetize their following. Any streamer or influencer, 
regardless of the size of their following, no longer has to wait to be approached 
by ad agencies for campaigns, and instead, can choose relevant and monetizable 
content for their followers.  Influencers with niche yet active audiences who may 
not have been sponsorship material previously, can now potentially earn a living.  

 
• Even the average gamer can share in the token economy just for doing 

what they love.  Simply by sharing links or moving up a gaming level, anyone 
can earn RFR tokens.  The blockchain referral ecosystem will now allow the 
99% of gamers that actually make up the vibrant community to participate 
economically as well.

Industry Dynamics

Game Developer

Video games is a busy industry with many developers but few distributors.

With lower barriers to entry, the number of game creators has increased significantly.  
A few key players dominate digital distribution and capture the majority of the 
games advertising revenues.  In addition, all top platforms charge 30% of revenue 
to simply distribute digital products, further increasing their grip with game 
developers. 

Developers have to spend more and more on conventional advertising

Advertising algorithms and policies are opaque

While ad networks have improved immensely on their ability to target, there are 
still problems with transparency.  Dominant channels impose rules that can easily 
change at any moment without consultation from game developers or the wider 
community. That means that developers are left rather powerless when it comes to 
marketing their games.

There have also been several instances where ad platforms have indicated flaws in 
the metrics they have reported to advertisers, such as overstating app referrals, and 
inflating the amount of time consumers had watched video ads.  At other times, ad 
platforms have changed policies that demonetized content, leaving content creators 
demotivated and sometimes terrified at the sudden loss of revenues.  This reflects 
an opaque system in which the key players define the metrics, exercise full rights 
over how their ad algorithms can be managed, and have minimal external oversight 
or audit controls.

A scalable solution 
to directly involve or 
engage players does 
not exist

channels to reach gamers. Targeting specific players 
can be exasperating: developers often have no choice 
but to pay major digital distributors for in-stream 
advertising or sponsored content in social media.  
A scalable marketing solution to directly involve or 
engage players does not exist.

Referral Marketing
Since the start of society, decision-making and purchasing behavior have revolved 
around social influence.  Referral marketing is considered the key factor in countless 
success stories, such as  Amazon, Dropbox, Uber, Airbnb, and Tesla. Social relevance 
provides a stronger backbone, particularly in game-playing communities where 
multiplayer engagement is driven by groups and trends online.  

Attracting the right influencers is crucial to a successful referral marketing 
strategy.

Agencies (e.g Speakr, Instabrand) have emerged to try to match brands to 
influencers.  But the process is just time-consuming, costly, often nebulous, with 
disputable tracking, and lacking measurable goals, e.g. converting and paying 
each view, like, share, comment, thumbs up into a direct sale is complex and 
unaffordable.

Offers with 
recommendation by 
referral are accessible, 
relatable, targeted and

What drives a consumer to start playing a mobile game?

Referral success is well documented as the most 
effective strategy.  Offers with recommendation 
by referral are accessible, relatable, targeted, and 
trustworthy.  Developers who design referrals on 
social media platforms like Facebook have created 
some of the highest grossing games ever.  In just 
one year, game companies that used referrals saw 
growth from 3 million to 40 million average daily 
users. 



As an example, in 2016, companies spent $570m on sponsored posts on Instagram.  
Many such posts fail to reach their audience as algorithms filter out much of the 
content, reaching only 8-18% of the intended audience. 12 13  In addition, most brands 
still emphasize reach (i.e. number of followers) over true engagement.  Influencers 
therefore can feel pressure to ‘buy’ likes and followers as a way to increase their own 
prominence.

This further adds to the charts above indicates that 70% of an individual’s motivation 
to play a mobile game is based on recommendations by friends; at the same time, 
marketers say that the biggest challenges in working with influencers is identifying 
them (73%), measuring ROI (65%) and engaging with the influencer (59%).

So, while referral marketing can be a very powerful tool for developers, current 
technologies are not able to capture its full potential.

Influencer
Influencers are a growing phenomenon in gaming

They have an impassioned and loyal fanbase that was previously only possible for 
high-profile entertainers and political figures.  Gaming effectively has the largest 
reach of any vertical in social media, where the top 10 influencers gather an 
audience of 242 million. 14 These gamers leave reviews, recommend games to each 
other, share their gameplay and interact with fans in real time (e.g. via chats) on key 
gaming platforms.  Games like Dota 2 surpass 32m viewers compared to just 20m 
for Sunday Night Football.

By sharing their gameplay and interacting with fans in real time, Twitch and YouTube 
influencers draw massive attention to the games they play.  Gamers making videos 
and streaming games have become a billion-dollar industry in themselves.

Influencers are not properly compensated relative to their efforts

In the current ecosystem, most gamers and influencers are rarely rewarded with 
the monetary potential of their fanbase.  A few elite influencers (e.g. PewDiePie with 
59m subs or Markiplier with 8m subs) have created their own mini-media empires

that are more professionally run, earning money via YouTube ads, sponsorships, and 
licensing deals.  But the vast majority of influencers are limited in how they can 
generate income.  While a new generation dreams of becoming full-time streamers, 
barriers to entry are high and they face the constant challenge of sustaining an 
income.

While streamers waiting for donations is the normalized status quo, it’s not 
capitalizing on their potential in the industry.

influencers are rarely

Current compensation methods have fallen prey to 
numerous examples of large centralized platforms 
changing policies to the detriment of individuals.  
Currently, streamers deploy dozens of complicated 
techniques, from disruptive banner ads to 
unrelated endorsements in a largely unsuccessful 
attempt to monetize content. 



Architecture and Implementation

Refereum is based on referrals and is built on Blockchain technology.  It allows 
developers to promote their games by buying RFR tokens which can then be 
distributed to influencers and gamers for engaging in a variety of activities, e.g. 
referring, buying, and playing games.

The platform fundamentally incentivizes users to engage with each other beyond 
initial purchases (e.g. chatting on Discord). 

Blockchain Introduction

Blockchain has the potential to change fundamentally how we conduct business.  
One of the most profound impacts will come in the way we interact at a peer-to-
peer level and how wealth can be distributed intelligently based on smart contracts, 
rather than controlled by a few dominant firms.

The blockchain is a new ecosystem, and its philosophy revolves around 
decentralization.  It has transparency and an inherent freedom from geographical 
constraints, legacy payment systems, censorship, and middlemen.  Today, this 
economy surpasses $550B.

The value of a cryptocurrency (i.e. a token) lies in the fundamental value it offers as a 
tool.  An Ethereum (ERC20) token is programmed with the information of a contract 
between two parties, the wallets of potential recipients, and a way of determining 
the outcome objectively.  As an example, imagine a game of heads or tails.  Two 
people can write a contract to bet money on the outcome of a coin toss. What if the 
contract was written on — or rather, in — the flipped coin? This is a smart contract 
which is programmed into the token.

The blockchain can be used to resolve the specific issues of referral marketing in the 
video game industry.  It has been impossible to reward players with fiat currency 
because of complex legislative and geopolitical restrictions, but the Refereum 
solution removes such barriers.  

For an economic system to maintain or grow, there needs to be an ecology of 
needs, suppliers, and innovators. The Refereum economy is primed with developers, 
gamers, and influencers.

13



RFR Token

To revolutionize the game industry, we are building on the foundation of the 
Ethereum Blockchain to create a platform that, until now, has been impossible.  
The architecture of the RFR token is core to the technology and complies with the 
ERC20 standard.15

Participating parties can already interact with the system using a wide variety of 
Ethereum clients.  Refereum is featured as an official partner of the Connext API to 
allow the purchase of RFR securely with conventional payment methods like credits 
cards for average consumers.

By utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Refereum provides a secure, reliable, and 
auditable way for game developers, influencers, and gamers to come together 
and be rewarded.  While the Refereum platform provides tools to simplify and 
encourage engagement between these groups, the RFR token will be able to 
transfer from any user to any other user without interacting with the Refereum 
platform.  This shifts further control of the decentralized virtual currency to the 
community. 
 

Mechanism to purchase RFR Token

Purchasing a game with Refereum tokens on Refereum.com is one of 
the quickest and easiest ways to get value from the blockchain.  With the 
widely adopted MetaMask Chrome plugin, users can buy games with just 
2-clicks directly in their browser.  Additionally, we allow users to sign their 
own blockchain transaction and make a purchase manually by calling the 
TransferToIcap() function of our smart contract.  

Users can chose ease of use or full control, whichever they prefer.  Once a transaction 
in the Refereum ICAP address space is confirmed, the game key is automatically 
shown in the users web account and a receipt of the transaction, in the form of an 
Ethereum transaction, is stored on the blockchain forever.  The transaction record 
specifies which game was purchased by which user, and this is auditable by players 
and developers alike without the need for Refereum’s interaction without linking 
addresses to accounts. 

Mechanism to reward RFR Token

We believe in the open source approach for security, developer ease of use, and 
further adoption of the platform.  Usage of the open source blockchain rejects 
centralization of control and mandates transparency.  We have already created 
an open source example of earning (testnet) Refereum inside a game for anyone 
to see on Refereum.com and help them model their own games.  As developers 
contact us to implement further rewards for influencers, they might look toward 
other applications of Refereum for best practices.  Simple or widely useful 

14



implementations will be stored in a public and easily accessible repository with 
detailed documentation.

ICAP

ICAP, the Inter exchange Client Address Protocol, is a feature of the Ethereum 
blockchain that allows transfer of funds between 3rd party accounts. By utilizing this 
technology the Refereum platform can securely track the source of an Ethereum 
transaction without the user needing to supply any of their private information. A 
unique ICAP address is generated for any user that specifies which game they are 
purchasing.  By utilizing MetaMask, users are freed from needing to enter their ICAP 
address as Refereum automatically generates the transaction for the user to simply 
review before submitting onto the blockchain.

RFR Smart Contract

Contract ERC20 {

function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);

function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);

function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);

function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success); 

function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);

function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining); 

event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);

event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value); }

Use Cases / Utility Today

We invite you to watch the video walkthrough of how easy it is to use RFR tokens 
today on Refereum.com.

The top 3 virtual currency utility uses of RFR tokens today are:

1.       Anyone can buy games on Refereum.com using RFR tokens and view        
 their receipt on the blockchain

2.       Game developers can pay RFR tokens to feature their game and sponsor  
  additional engagement on Refereum.com

3.       Sellers of digital goods can pay to list their products for distribution by paying  
 RFR token

Developer

Radical Studios have spent their savings creating an awesome new game. Before, 
the studio had to spend money on ineffective Facebook ads — or hire an expensive 
marketing agency that ended up providing mixed results. 
With Refereum, Radical Studios adds their game to the Refereum platform and 
offers a high referral bonus for anyone who refers purchases of their game. Instead 
of paying 30% to traditional distribution platforms, they can choose to share 10% of 
profits with streamers who help sell their game via referrals and create content for it. 

Influencer

Rachel is trying to make it as a full-time streamer on Twitch. She has a following, but 
she’s certainly not in the top 1% of streamers. Before, Rachel had to wait and hope 
that strangers would donate to her stream. 

Now, Rachel can use Refereum.com and find relevant games for her fans. Rachel 
and her fans have access to cheaper games and cash rewards for any purchases 
made through her referral link. She can trade her tokens to finance her career or 
buy more games to stream

16



Gamers

Rod enjoys watching streams of video games but is starting to wonder if there’s 
more productive use of his time. 

With Refereum, developers attract gamers like Rod to new games, so Rod is now 
paid for engaging (by watching or playing) with new games. Rod can use this same 
virtual currency to buy more games.

17

We believe in the open source approach for security, developer ease of use and 
further adoption of the platform.  Usage of the open source blockchain rejects 
centralization of control and mandates transparency.  We have already created 
an open source example of earning (testnet) Refereum inside a game for anyone 
to see on Refereum.com and help them model their own games. As developers 
contact us to implement further rewards for influencers, they might look toward 
other applications of Refereum for best practices.  Simple or widely useful 
implementations will be stored in a public and easily accessible repository with 
detailed documentation. 

We have created a solid foundation and look forward to working closely with the 
open source community to provide the best technical solutions. 

All transactions of the Refereum utility token are tracked on the Ethereum 
blockchain. This allows developers to see exactly how many copies of their game 
are selling and influencers to track how many people are buying games from their 
recommendation.

Customers

Some of the largest and most well known companies in the game industry are already 
using the Refereum platform today. For instance, Epic Games (Unreal tournament, Gears 
of War, etc) have sponsored Refereum with their top Twitch game ‘Fortnite’ to attract more 
streamers and downloads. The platform has provided tens of thousands of downloads and 
other game purchases.   

Refereum streamers are constantly sending us screenshots of their great results with the 
platform as seen below. Below, a screenshot from ‘DownToQuest’ is featured:  



Industry Support

Platform adoption has been accelerated by Refereum’s integration with Twitch, 
the most popular and established game streaming platform; and Discord, the 
communication tool popular with gamers.  Both Twitch and Unity, the world’s 
most popular game engine, have voiced support for the Refereum solution 
to see on Refereum.com.  In addition, any of the users who gain access to 
tokens can use them on Refereum.com for redeemable game keys on existing 
distribution platforms.  Developers can already add their games to sell, or 
incentivize influencer traffic with Refereum tokens.  With open source code for 
this technology, the Refereum team has created a strong foundation for this 
Blockchain technology platform.

Influencers’ streams are well on the way to replacing TV. 16 17 When Amazon 
purchased Twitch for nearly $1 billion, some were surprised that a website dedicated 
to watching people play games could be worth so much. 

A closer look at its user base, user engagement, and user retention statistics shows 
why Twitch is so valuable.  Twitch has over 1 million unique broadcasters creating 
6 million videos a month. These videos attract 45 million unique gamers a month, 
each of whom watch this content for an average of 1.5+ hours a day. 18

Reaching out to all these individuals separately is an impossible task, but offering 
systematic incentives is easy on the Refereum platform.  In this latter scenario, 
campaigns do not have to be hand-targeted towards specific individuals; instead, 
engagement is driven by influencers themselves checking the platform.  The content 
they create is already an ad for the game itself, and Refereum capitalizes on this.

Additionally, Refereum works across country borders with other top streaming 
platforms like Korea’s Afreeca and China’s Huya and Douya with simple referral links.  
Before Refereum, there were no marketing solutions that thrived in these intimate 
and real-time relationships between influencers and their fans. These incentives 
provide the perfect foundation for growth on a viral curve, as it offers the easiest and 
most effective way for influencers to monetize their passion.

“ We strive to help streamers and game 
developers. We know Refereum shares these 
goals, and we plan to keep collaborating on the 
future of game streaming.”

— Ernest Le, Director of Publisher & Developer

Unity is the most used game engine ever.  It has the largest market share of 
developer use and it deploys to every gaming platform — from mobile to VR.  Unity 
games have been downloaded 5 billion times 19  by players on over 2.4 billion unique 
devices. 20 From their asset store, Unity will provide an asset that offers one-click 
implementation of Refereum tools for any developer in its immense ecosystem.

Further integration of Refereum is an especially easy implementation for the 
majority of game genres that already rely on any virtual currency to progress or 
use Unity.  Such tool allows developers to implement Refereum into any current or 
future game with ease. 

With trivial deeper implementation in response to the community for any game 
engine (including Unreal, Crysis, Lumberyard, custom engines, and more), Refereum 
removes barriers for developers using blockchain technology. 

Referral marketing done well is a very powerful strategy to drive business.  Refereum 
has purposely focused on gaming industry because it is where our heart is, but 
also because it is the best testing ground for this revolutionary technology.  But in 
practice Refereum is totally industry agnostic.  Smart contracts can be created for 
anyone eager to leverage the power of referral marketing to achieve a certain goal.

2018 will be a very busy year for the team, and our sole focus will be on becoming 
the go-to platform for gaming.  But pretty soon we will test appetite in adjacent 
industries such as entertainment in general, as well as other industries where 
influencers have proven to be a powerful voice in their respective fields.  Think of 
fitness, beauty products, pets, kids, technology products, travel, retail, auto.

The point here is that Refereum is adopting a solid strategy.  Become the best in the 
industry you love, then expand for others to benefit.

“We plan to support Refereum tools and 
assets to help developers keep being 
successful with Unity.“

— Ian Dunlap, Asset Store Manager at Unity

TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS:

THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE, AND 
IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL TEXT OF THE TOKEN SALE 
MEMORANDUM, AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS, WHICH WILL BE PROVIDED TO EACH PROSPECTIVE 
PURCHASER UPON REQUEST.

PROSPECTIVE TOKEN PURCHASERS SHOULD NOT CONSTRUE THIS WHITE PAPER AS PROVIDING ANY LEGAL 
OR TAX ADVICE. THIS WHITE PAPER CURRENTLY CONTAINS A FAIR SUMMARY OF REFEREUM’S VISION, AND 
THE OPERATION AND UTILITY OF ITS TOKEN. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN ITS TOKEN SALE 
MEMORANDUM, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATING IN REFEREUM’S TOKEN 
SALE. PARTICIPATION IN A TOKEN SALE CAN BE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND COULD INVOLVE A RISK OF TOTAL 
LOSS. A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER SHOULD THOROUGHLY REVIEW THE TOKEN SALE MEMORANDUM UPON 
ITS RELEASE AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER PURCHASING RFR TOKENS IS ADVISABLE GIVEN THE 
PURCHASER’S FINANCIAL POSITIONING AND GOALS. THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE OFFERING 
OF A SECURITY. THE REGULATORY TREATMENT OF TOKEN SALES IS A LIVE AND DEVELOPING ISSUE, AND NO 
ASSESSMENT IS CONCLUSIVE. REFEREUM TAKES THE POSITION THAT ITS RFR TOKEN IS NOT A SECURITY, 
BUT A UTILITY TOKEN GIVEN ITS OPERATION AND IMMEDIATE FUNCTIONALITY. AS SUCH, RFR TOKENS, HAVE 
NOT AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED OR FILED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY 
JURISDICTION. FURTHER, THIS TOKEN SALE IS NOT BEING PROVIDED THROUGH ANY OF THE EXEMPTIONS 
UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT. NO REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY 
OF REFEREUM’S SELF-ASSESSMENT THAT ITS TOKEN SALE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SECURITIES OFFERING. 
ALTHOUGH DUE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED, AND REFEREUM HAS TAKEN STEPS TO MITIGATE 
REGULATORY RISK, GIVEN THAT BLOCKCHAIN IS A YOUNG INDUSTRY, AND TOKEN SALES ARE A NOVEL AND 
EVOLVING DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS INEVITABLY A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH ANY TOKEN SALE. GIVEN 
THE RAPIDLY CHANGING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE AND WARNINGS SIGNALED BY MULTIPLE INTERNATIONAL 
JURISDICTIONS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FOR TOKENS TO BE VIEWED AS SECURITIES OFFERINGS, THERE 
IS ALWAYS A RISK THAT THE RFR UTILITY TOKEN MAY NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM SECURITIES REGISTRATION 
REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. MANY INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS 
HAVE INDICATED THAT  TOKEN SALES MAY QUALIFY AS SALES OF INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, OR QUALIFY AS 
CROWDFUNDING SALES UNDER PRE-EXISTING REGULATIONS, AND MAY BE REGULATED AS SUCH. IN VIEW OF 
THE GUIDANCE RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM THESE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IT IS LIKELY THAT A GROWING 
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WILL BE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING TOKEN SALES. REFEREUM’S REPRESENTATIONS 
AND SECURITIES ASSESSMENT IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION (SEC) OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY WILL NOT DETERMINE THE TOKENS TO BE 
SECURITIES SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION. THE RFR TOKENS HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED 
BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION IN 
THE UNITED STATES, OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SAME APPLIES 
TO RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED ANY FORM OF GUIDANCE AS TO INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS AND TOKEN 
SALES, SUCH AS ABU DHABI, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, DUBAI, GIBRALTAR, HONG KONG, ISRAEL, 
JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA, SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE 
FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF ANY 
INFORMATION IN THIS WHITE PAPER OR THE TOKEN SALE MEMORANDUM, NOR IS IT INTENDED THAT THE 
FOREGOING AUTHORITIES WILL DO SO. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY WOULD BE A CRIMINAL 
OFFENSE. SHOULD REFEREUM’S TOKENS BE DEEMED SECURITIES BY THE SEC, OR ANOTHER REGULATORY 
AUTHORITY, REFEREUM AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE RFR TOKEN SALE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL 
PENALTIES IF THE TOKENS ARE NOT PROPERLY REGISTERED. AS SUCH, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD 
MAKE THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS AND EVALUATIONS OF REFEREUM, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS 
INVOLVED IN PURCHASING RFR TOKENS. IN COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAWS, 
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS LOCATED IN, UNDER THE CONTROL OF, OR A NATIONAL OR RESIDENT OF ANY 
RESTRICTED LOCATION OR COUNTRY TO WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS EMBARGOED GOODS OR SERVICES, 
ARE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE TOKEN SALE. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT 
LIMITED TO, CUBA, THE CRIMEA REGION OF UKRAINE, IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SOMALIA, SUDAN, 
AND SYRIA. AS SUCH, THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL, OR ASOLICITATION OF 
AN OFFER TO BUY, RFR TOKENS IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE SUCH AN OFFER 
OR SOLICITATION AND IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. REFEREUM SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION 
TO ISSUE ANY TOKENS TO ANY PERSON WHO IS A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE ISSUANCE 
OF TOKENS TO HIM/HER/IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF LAW. REFEREUM RETAINS THE SOLE RIGHT, 
IN ITS COMPLETE DISCRETION, TO ACCEPT OR REJECT TOKEN SALE PURCHASES, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR 
ANY REASON. ANY REJECTED TRANSACTION SHALL BE REFUNDED. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS 
WHITE PAPER WAS CREATED BY REFEREUM FROM ITS OWN INTERNAL RECORDS AND FROM PUBLISHED AND 
UNPUBLISHED SOURCES IT BELIEVES TO BE RELIABLE. NEITHER THIS WHITE PAPER NOR ANY SUPPLEMENTARY 
DATA PURPORTS TO BE INCLUSIVE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, EACH PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER IS EXPECTED TO 
CONDUCT HIS/HER/ITS OWN “DUE DILIGENCE” AND RELY ON HIS/HER/ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES. NEITHER 
REFEREUM, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, ADVISORS, OR AGENTS, MAKE ANY
