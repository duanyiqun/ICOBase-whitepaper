V 2.8 



Abstract 

The blockchain technology provides a digital trust mechanism for human beings 

which enhances the efficiency of exchange of an asset that is of value to someone 

including but not limited to votes, IP etc. and reduces costs - the genuinely credible 

and efficient Internet of Value is approaching. In recent years, many breakthroughs 

have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and AI is now penetrating 

every corner of society and will become an essential cornerstone of change in society. 

Nebula AI Inc., (Nebula AI) is committed to building a decentralized artificial 

intelligence computing blockchain (NBAI) that reduces the energy costs of traditional 

Proof of Work by converting GPU mining machines into AI computing services. The 

AI transactions recorded on NBAI will be irreversible. The distributed computing 

network also ensures high concurrency and low latency computing power. The 

conversion of GPU mining machines makes it possible to provide more cost-effective 

artificial intelligence services. 

Nebula AI will cooperate with large-scale third-party Internet data centers to 

provide adequate computing power for AI computing. Nebula AI has established an 

artificial intelligence training centre in Canada. System-based quantitative finance, 

image identification and other blockchain applications are also in development. 

The well-developed NBAI ecosystem integrates the top-level applications such as 

DAI App, scientific research and application, university education, and the bottom-

level of NBAI blockchain, Artificial Intelligence Mining Machine and Artificial 

Intelligence Data Center. The innovative economic model of the NBAI ecosystem is 

the realization of a complete set of value-added economic systems.

Some of the statements in the whitepaper which reflect Nebula AI’s current views with respect 

to roadmap and future plans, both with respect to the Distributor(Nebula AI Inc.) and the sectors 

�  vii



and industries in which Nebula AI operates. Statements which include the words “expects”, 

“plans”, “believes”, “projects”, “anticipates”, “will”, “aims”, “may”, “would”, “could”, “continue” 

and similar statements are of a future or forward-looking nature. All forward-looking statements 

address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important 

factors that could cause Nebula AI’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated in 

these statements. Any forward-looking statements in the Whitepaper reflect the Distributor’s 

current views with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties 

and assumptions relating to Nebula AI’s operations, results of operations and growth strategy. 

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the Whitepaper. Prospective buyers 

of the NBAI tokens should specifically consider the factors identified in the Whitepaper which 

could cause actual results to differ before making a purchase decision. No statement in the 

Whitepaper is intended as a profit forecast and no statement in the Whitepaper should be 

interpreted to mean that the earnings of the Distributor for the current or future years would be as 

may be implied in this Whitepaper. 

In addition, there are other risks in the process of development, maintenance and operation of 

the NBAI ecosystem, many of them which are out of Nebula AI’s control. You acknowledge that 

you understand and agree to the assumption of the following risks, including but not limited to the 

following: 

• Uncertain laws relating to digital token offerings: The regulatory position of NBAI 

tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear and/or unsettled in certain jurisdictions, 

and there may be risks that the NBAI token may be considered to be a security, or that it 

might be considered to be a security in the future, in these jurisdictions. Nebula AI may 

cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or 

regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to 

obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. 

�  viii



• Security issues: Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to 

interfere with the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not 

limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil 

attacks, guerilla-style attacks, smurf attack and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a 

third party or Nebula AI may unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core 

infrastructure of the Platform and/or the NBAI tokens, which could negatively affect the 

Platform and/or the NBAI tokens.  

• Ethereum-based protocols: As the NBAI token and the Platform are based on 

Ethereum-based protocol and architecture, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of 

the relevant Ethereum-based protocol or architecture may have a material adverse effect on 

the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical 

advances (including, but not limited to, the development of quantum computing), could 

present unknown risks to the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform by rendering ineffective the 

cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum-based protocol. 

• Imperfect information disclosures: The Platform is at the stage of development as of 

the date of these Terms and its algorithm, code, consensus mechanism and/or various other 

technical specifications and parameters could be updated and changed frequently and 

constantly. While the White Paper and other marketing materials (as the case may be) 

released relating to the development of the Platform has been prepared with the then up-to-

date key information of the Platform, it is subject to adjustments and updates from time to 

time following the growth and development of the Platform and/or the ecosystem on the 

Platform. Due to the decentralized nature of the Platform, Nebula AI may not be able to, 

and is not obliged to, update you on all details relating to the development of the Platform 

(including, but not limited to, its progress and expected milestones). By purchasing, 

holding and using the NBAI tokens, you accept that there may be an insufficiency of the 

information disclosed. 

�  ix



• Early development risks: You understand and accept that the Platform is currently in a 

development phase and requires substantial development. Due to unforeseeable material 

conceptual, technical and commercial changes before the final release, you understand and 

accept the risk that the development of the Platform may not be executed or implemented 

as planned, for reasons including but not limited to, the event of a decline in the prices of 

any digital asset, virtual currency or NBAI token, unforeseen technical difficulties, and the 

shortage of funds for developing Nebula AI’s cryptocurrency project. 

• Illiquidity: There is no prior market for NBAI tokens and the NBAI token sale may not 

result in an active or liquid market for NBAI tokens. The NBAI token is intended to be 

used solely within the network of the Platform, hence there may be an illiquidity risk with 

respect to any NBAI token held.  

• Uninsured losses: The NBAI token is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private 

insurance to insure them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value of the NBAI token, 

there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Nebula AI to offer any recourse 

to you. 

• Tax treatment: The tax characterization of the NBAI token is uncertain. You must seek 

your own tax advice in connection with the purchase, holding and/or usage of the NBAI 

tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding, taxes, 

income taxes and tax reporting requirements. 

• Competitors: It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize 

the same or similar code and protocol underlying the NBAI token and/or the Platform and 

attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Platform may be required to compete with these 

alternative networks, which could negatively impact the NBAI token and/or the Platform. 

�  x



• Risks arising from insufficient interest: It is possible that the Platform may not be 

used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there may be 

limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as 

the Platform). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of 

the Platform and therefore the potential utility of the NBAI token. 

• Risks of dissolution: It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but 

not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, 

decrease in the utility of the NBAI token due to negative adoption of the Platform, the 

failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the 

Platform may no longer be viable to operate and Nebula AI may be dissolved. 

• Risks arising from lack of governance rights: As the NBAI token confers no 

governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform or Nebula AI, all decisions 

involving the Platform or Nebula AI will be made by Nebula AI at its sole and absolute 

discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the services and/or the 

ecosystem on the Platform, to create and sell more NBAI tokens for use in the ecosystem 

on the Platform, or to sell or liquidate Nebula AI. These corporate decisions could 

adversely affect the Platform and the NBAI token that you hold. 

• Loss of talent: The development of the Platform depends on the continued co-

operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who may have specialized 

knowledge and expertise in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely 

affect the Platform or its future development.  

• Risks relating to “forking”: The Platform is based on certain open-source elements 

and Nebula AI does not monopolize the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of 

the Platform. Any entity may independently develop a patch or upgrade to the Platform and 

the acceptance of these patches or upgrades by a sufficient percentage of NBAI token 

�  xi



holders could result in two or more divergent networks. The community on the Platform 

may split in support of the divergent networks respectively. The temporary or permanent 

existence of forked networks could adversely affect the operation of the Platform and the 

NBAI token that you hold. 

• No ownership and control rights: Ownership of the NBAI tokens does not grant you 

the right of ownership or right to share in Nebula AI. The NBAI tokens do not give NBAI 

token holders the right to participate in the decision making about the direction and 

development of the Nebula AI business. However, the opinions of NBAI token holders and 

the Platform users are very important to Nebula AI and may be taken into account by 

Nebula AI when such decisions are being made. 

• Risk on the number and value of the NBAI tokens: The quantum and value of the 

NBAI tokens may be affected by factors, within or outside Nebula AI’s control, including 

but not limited to the supply and demand for NBAI tokens in the market. These factors 

could adversely affect the quantum and value of the NBAI tokens.

1. Technology and Industry Overview 

1.1   The Internet of Value 

The traditional Internet is based on historical content (instead of creating new value) and is 

known by the industry as the Internet of Information. The blockchain technology, on the other 

hand, has evolved the Internet into a network infrastructure for building social trust systems 

through the establishment of an efficient and reliable value exchange system, which will enable the 

Internet to generate new value and realize the efficient exchange of value, otherwise known by 

the industry as the Internet of Value. 

1.1.1.   Blockchain Technology Development 

Blockchain technology is a comprehensive technology system based on distributed systems, 

computer networks, cryptography, data structures and other research results in various fields. The 

technology in blockchain records and maintains data in multiple ways, ensures data transmission 

and access security by applying cryptography, and the data is stored in a chain structure and can 

only be read or written so as to ensure its consistency, prevents tampering and cannot be denied. 

Blockchain technology represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum implements peer-to-peer credit 

transactions between distributed nodes by adding technologies such as data encryption, consensus 

mechanisms, timestamps, and economic incentives. It has solved the problems of cumbersome and 

inefficient transaction cycles, high costs and unsafe data storage, which have become 

commonplace in traditional centralized systems, and became the nuclear technology of the modern 

digital cryptocurrency system. This technology system enables information consensus, sharing, 

and co-responsibility among all participants that can be entirely ported to the underlying 

applications of most trust-based business models and organizations. 

Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin Design Paper Bitcoins: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic 

�  of �1 54



Cash System in 2008, where he indicated to create a new decentralized electronic payment system, 

which “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact 

directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party [12]”. From then on, the 

blockchain technology represented by Bitcoin began to be known to the world. 

Blockchain technology is typically divided into two generations by industry and academia: 

• Bitcoin — solves the problem of encrypting ledger and decentralized payments. 

• Ethereum — enriches the application value of blockchain technology. The smart 

contracts used by Ethereum can use virtual machines and contract programming to 

provide new ideas for the development of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, a large 

number of DApps and ICO financial innovations came into being, opening up new 

territory for financial markets. 

As the first application of the blockchain, Bitcoin realized the mode of the decentralized 

cryptocurrency ledger system. Bitcoin relies on the completion of computational tasks based on a 

particular algorithm and does not depend on any individual or organization, thereby ensuring 

consistency with the distributed ledger system. Vitalik Buterin applied the concept of smart 

contracts in his design of Ethereum [4], giving us a common framework for blockchain with 

Turing completeness. 

The application of blockchain technology establishes credible peer-to-peer transmission, which 

provides us with a new social trust mechanism, supporting common decision-making whilst 

protecting individual rights and interests, and both opening transaction information whilst 

protecting node privacy. This mechanism enhances the efficiency of the value exchange and 

reduces the cost, laying a new foundation for the development of the digital economy. It marks the 

beginning that society evolves from the Internet of Information to building a genuinely credible 

and efficient Internet of Value. At the same time, the application of blockchain innovation is 

thriving, reflecting the new direction of public service development and industrial innovation 

revolution.

1.1.2.   DApp and Artificial  Intell igence 

DApp (Decentralized Application) is a kind of application that runs on the node of the 

decentralized P2P network server. It mainly consists of front end presentation layer, background 

server and smart contract. With the rapid development of Ethereum, a few millions DApps have 

emerged in all walks of life, and the Internet of Value ecosystem is increasingly complete. 

In recent years, many breakthroughs have been made in the field of artificial intelligence, and 

there is a wave of research on artificial intelligence on a global scale. The research and application of 

artificial intelligence have now penetrated every gap in human society, which has also been 

integrated with the application of DApps. However, the research on artificial intelligence requires 

strong computational power, which has been promoted from the early stage of CPU computation 

to GPU computing. The large-scale application deployment has higher requirements on hardware 

performance and system concurrent processing. 

Nebula AI blockchain, as a new generation of AI blockchain, is dedicated to solving the 

computing power needs of human beings in the process of artificial intelligence, expediting the 

inter-regional transfer of resources and writing integrated and decentralized AI applications more 

conveniently, so as to realize a seamless integration of blockchain micropayments, hyperledger, 

decentralized features, and AI applications and achieve the transformation from DApp + AI to 

DAI App. 

Nebula AI is committed to building a decentralized artificial intelligence computing 

blockchain (NBAI) that reduces the energy costs of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) by converting 

GPU mining machines into AI computing services. On the Nebula AI blockchain, developers can 

design their own DAI Apps based on Nebula AI’s generic programming interface, and gain rewards 

as NBAI Tokens by publishing Apps. The AI transactions recorded on NBAI will be irreversible. 

The distributed computing network also ensures high concurrency and low latency computing 

power. The conversion of GPU mining machines makes it possible to provide more cost-effective 

artificial intelligence services. Nebula AI has established an artificial intelligence training centre in 

Canada and is dedicated to disseminating the latest applications and knowledge in the AI industry 

�  of �3 54



and delivering talents to society. Also, Nebula AI will cooperate with large-scale third-party 

Internet data centres to provide computing power for AI computing. System-based quantitative 

finance, image identification and other related blockchain applications are also in development. 

The NBAI blockchain will inject fresh blood into the Internet of Value and provide cost-

effective basic services for global artificial intelligence development. 

1.2     Market Prospects 

Blockchain technology has achieved global application deployment. All countries are closely 

watching the development of the blockchain, and planning the application of the blockchain. 

According to market research firm Gartner, the value of blockchain-based businesses will reach 

100 billion U.S. dollars by 2020. In addition to the large-scale application of blockchain 

technology to the financial sector, blockchain technology will create over one trillion US dollars in 

value in the manufacturing and supply chain industries. Klaus Schwab pointed out that the 

blockchain is the fourth industrial revolution after mechanization, electrification and digitization. 

It is estimated that by 2025, 10% of the global GDP will use blockchain technology for data 

storage [17]. Marketsand Markets forecasts that the average annual growth of global blockchain 

applications and solution providers to improve business operations will reach its peak between 

2016 and 2021 [9]. The market prospects of blockchain technology mainly lies in social public 

services and economic models optimization. 

At the level of social public service, blockchain technology is penetrating into areas of social 

security, intellectual property and public administration, and mainly focuses on four areas: identity 

verification, forensic authentication, information sharing, and transparent governance. The British 

government released, for the first time, the report Distributed ledger technology: Beyond 

Blockchain in 2016, which explores the critical application of distributed ledger in government 

affairs [19]. Subsequently, the United States set up a “Congressional Blockchain Caucus” and the 

governments of Russia, Singapore, Dubai, Japan and China all accelerated the social application 

of blockchain technology [14]. Under the influence of the underlying philosophy of distributed 

consensus, transparent open source and social collaboration of blockchain technology, the public 

�  of �4 54



service realizes an overall change from data management process optimization to management 

thinking, that helps to increase public participation, reduce social operating costs and improve the 

quality and efficiency of social management, which plays an important role in promoting the level 

of social management and governance. 

At the level of economic optimization, the core philosophy of the blockchain economy   lies in the 

reconstruction of business logic, creating a new pattern of finance and economy in the future, not 

just a technological revolution [6]. As early as 2015, the blockchain has become the highest-paid 

sector in U.S. venture capital. The current global blockchain has more than 2,000 projects, and the 

global value of cryptocurrency assets amounts to 90 billion US dollars. Blockchain has high 

application value regarding finance, shared economy and Internet of Things, which has attracted the 

wide layout of business groups such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Nasdaq, Deloitte and Airbnb. 

User groups in the fields of blockchain/cryptocurrency assets are also growing rapidly: from 2 million 

users worldwide in early 2013 to 20 million users in early 2017 [18]. In the blockchain system, 

participants can trade without having to know each other’s basic information so as to achieve 

“trustless trust” and change the third-party-based trust model in the traditional mode, and the 

economic system can be out of the current system’s constraints or endorsement by third parties, 

resulting in the situation whereby two sides realize the delivery of value. An economy based on 

blockchain solutions can improve existing business rules, build a new industrial collaboration model 

and improve the efficiency of collaborative logistics. Blockchain can provide systematic support for 

economic and social transformation and upgrading [16]. The significant advantages are the 

optimization of business processes, lower operating costs and synergy, and these advantages have 

emerged in all areas of society, including financial services, supply chain management, smart 

manufacturing, education and employment. 

After 60 years of ups and downs, the artificial intelligence industry is finally recovering with 

the rise of machine learning. As it has now formed a new round of development in the world, 

countries have sounded the horn to explore the mysteries of human wisdom. The scale of the 

global artificial intelligence market reached 168.39 billion US dollars in 2015. In 2016, the 

research and development of artificial intelligence in all fields in the world have been 

�  of �5 54



strengthened and emphasized, with the market scale of the industry increasing to more than 190 

billion US dollars [11]. According to the market demand, the global market size of artificial 

intelligence is expected to reach 270 billion US dollars by 2018.  

DApp will form the backbone of the internet of value in the future. Artificial intelligence will 

cover all application areas. Blockchain, as the infrastructure of the former two, will undoubtedly 

become popular and will inevitably bring significant changes to the traditional Internet, society 

and the natural environment. 

1.3    Existing Challenges 

1. Highly Centralized 

Google and Amazon have started to provide cloud services of artificial intelligence computing. 

However, as single-commerce companies, they could stop providing the service at any time, given 

special circumstances, which are based on their own interests and the pressure of, for instance, 

governments and other organizations. For example, Google was banned by the Chinese 

government, leaving Chinese users unable to utilize their services. 

The blockchain is a new decentralized protocol that securely stores data information through a 

distributed ledger (a type of database distributed across multiple addresses, multiple regions, or 

multiple participants) [3]. The blockchain is based on the architecture of “decentralization”. The 

rights and obligations of any nodes are equal; the data blocks in the system are jointly maintained 

by all nodes, and each node shares rights and obligations, is verified by node distribution in the 

world, to ensure that the information cannot be forged and tampered with; and technically 

guaranteeing the transaction, without the need for a third-party structure to provide a trust 

mechanism. Corporations use decentralized distributed ledger technology to process, verify 

transactions, or other types of data exchange, and the records are stored in the ledger. Once most 

participants agree, each record is given a time stamp and a unique encrypted signature. The 

distributed ledger provides verifiable and auditable information history, and all participants can 

�  of �6 54



view suspicious records [10]. This technique guarantees that it is impossible to shut down the 

entire network as long as more than one node is in operation. This makes it possible to design a 

decentralized AI cloud service which cannot be blocked. 

2. Data Privacy Security 

Although centralized companies have various security agreements, it is still difficult for 

companies to ensure data privacy when faced with internal leaks. Also, when the government 

requests for data, the centralized company is limited to geographical restrictions of the host 

country, leaving the only option to cooperate with the government and transfer ownership of the 

data. As a result, users’ data security cannot be 100% guaranteed. 

Based on the cryptography technology, blockchain is a kind of low cost, high security, 

customizable and encapsulated decentralized trust solution tool based on encryption technology, 

which relies on the encryption algorithm, peer-to-peer transaction and information stored in each 

node without trusting a single centre [20]. Each node is involved in maintaining the security and 

accuracy of the information by keeping a copy of a complete set of historical databases. The peer-

to-peer blockchain encryption technology can be used to ensure that only the owner of the private 

key can access specific information, while other users cannot decrypt data. This is of great 

significance for a variety of high-value training data and models. The advantages of blockchain in 

terms of data security are as follows: 

• Use highly redundant databases to ensure the integrity of the information. 

• Verify data using cryptography-related principles to ensure that the data cannot be 

tampered with. 

• Use multiple private keys for access control. 

3. Maintenance Costs 

The maintenance of a centralized computing center will cost heavily on the  workforce. Thus, 

the use of blockchain micropayments makes it easier to pay for maintenance and allows anyone to 

lend their computing power. The shared economy model dramatically reduces maintenance 

�  of �7 54



workforce costs as well as computing costs.  

4. Hash Calculation Efficiency 

Currently Ethereum, Zcash and other GPU PoW consume a lot of power and hash computing. 

The computing power of these GPUs can be used for AI calculations, rather than simply being 

used as PoW. A recent study shows that Bitcoin mining has consumed more electricity than the 

average annual electricity consumption of 159 countries this year. Such a high level of power 

consumption has become an urgent problem to be solved. Digiconomist estimates that Bitcoin 

mining consumes about 30.14TWh annually, which is much higher than the average annual 

electricity consumption of 25TWh in Ireland [8]. In fact, a recent ING study by ABN AMRO 

shows that a Bitcoin transaction consumes enough power for a full week of average American 

household use [21]. Digiconomist also found that mining the second most expensive 

cryptocurrency, Ethereum, consumes more power than that of most countries [1]. 

5. Blockchain Application Development Environment 

With the rapid growth of various applications (DApps) on the blockchain, a good state of the 

ecosystem is at the heart of the user experience. This includes how  users can retrieve their 

expected DApps in massive blockchain applications, how to motivate developers to provide more 

DApps to users, and how to help developers develop better DApps in a faster manner. Take 

Ethereum as an example, there are tens of thousands of DApps based on Ethereum. Imagine if the 

scale of DApps in the blockchain world is close to that of the Apple App Store, it would be a 

serious problem to discover and find a user’s expected DApps. With the popularity of blockchain 

technology, more and more application scenarios of blockchain technology have been discovered. 

Blockchain technology scenarios have been gradually expanded from the original cryptocurrency 

to more scenarios and user groups. For example, the community represented by Ethereum 

introduced the concept of smart contracts in blockchain technology, and Ripple used the 

blockchain technology to implement the real-time gross settlement system. With the increasing 

diversity of application scenarios, user demands for blockchain is also increasing, and we will 

�  of �8 54



expect to face more challenges. 

1.4     Project Objectives 

In order to improve the status quo of the current centralized cloud computing ecosystem, we 

intend to utilize the decentralization of blockchain technology to rent and distribute the computing 

power of artificial intelligence machines globally. Blockchain encryption technology efficiently 

avoids the problem of internal leakage and the maintenance of distributed AI calculation units is 

handed over to the owners of various AI calculation units, which considerably reduces the 

workload of maintenance. We split this overall goal into the following sub-goals: 

1.  Shared AI Computing Platform 

The shared AI computing device platform will address the unbalanced demand between 

consumers and suppliers of AI devices. Suppliers of AI computing devices are unable to use 100% 

of their computing power, which leads to some computing resources being idle. On the other hand, 

a large number of users who require the computing power of AI cannot obtain economical and 

efficient AI computing resources. Peer-to-peer payment in blockchain technology, as well as 

blockchain ledger technology, enable shared AI computing to be paid and shared in the most 

convenient way. 

2.   AI Physical Computing Units 

A large number of GPU computing mining machines can be converted into AI computing 

units, from simple hash calculations into more meaningful AI task calculations. Due to the 

particularity of AI calculations, it is necessary to pre-install the specified system and regularly 

update the client, including the ledger system, in order to play hardware performance better and 

share AI computing power. 

3.   Decentralized AI Applications 

Decentralized AI Applications system requires a corresponding interface for DAI App 

�  of �9 54



programmers to invoke conveniently and use the platform’s computing power. It includes the 

payment API, computing capacity estimation API and work estimation API, etc., in order to speed 

up the development of AI applications. 

4. Integrated IPFS Distributed Storage 

Decentralized applications require distributed file storage systems to store data. An option is 

the IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) storage system to replace the traditional centralized cloud 

storage or local file storage, in order to achieve better distributed storage. 

IPFS is a protocol and eponymous network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-

peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. The nodes in the IPFS 

network will form a distributed file system [2]. Most of the future IPFS will use cross-chain 

service. Please read the section of Cross-chain Service Usage to learn more about cross-chain 

technology. 

5. AI Engineer Training Center 

Nebula AI will establish a systematic artificial intelligence training center to provide practical 

knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. Engineers gradually create and train artificial 

intelligence models in product design through system learning and project operations. We are 

dedicated to disseminating the latest applications and knowledge in the AI industry and developing 

and delivering outstanding AI talents. Our mission is to fill the talent gap, and to give full play to 

the power of artificial intelligence in business. 

�  of �10 54



2. NBAI Ecosystem 
 

Figure 1: NBAI Ecosystem 

The NBAI ecosystem consists of two major components, the NBAI foundation and the NBAI 

system. The NBAI foundation supports the development, operation, and management of 

blockchain development platforms, AI joint labs, and engineer training centers. The NBAI system 

integrates the top-level applications such as DAI App, scientific research and application, 

university education, and the bottom-level of NBAI blockchain, Artificial Intelligence Mining 

�  of �11 54



Machine and Artificial Intelligence Data Center. 

 

Figure 2: NBAI Economic Model 

Figure 2 indicates the economic model of the NBAI ecosystem. Developers provide users with 

DAI Apps, users pay for NBAI tokens or use Apps for free based on the rules set by the 

developers. Developers submit artificial intelligence tasks to NBAI and pay for NBAI tokens 

based on NBAI’s estimated costs. Thereafter, NBAI will open the tasks, and miners are free to 

receive and handle the tasks from NBAI. NBAI will obtain the corresponding NBAI token as a 

reward after completing the tasks. Clients and miners can trade NBAI tokens through the cross-

chain token exchange platforms, so as to achieve a complete set of value-added economic systems. 

2.1    NBAI 

In the NBAI ecosystem, there are many deep training models (such as RNN, CNN and LSTM) 

to be trained, which requires large number of GPU computing to complete. In order to solve this 

problem, we have to change the manner of mining blockchain. Instead of simply using PoW as the 

solution, we intend to issue the NBAI tokens by PoW in early stages of roadmap (until 2018 Q3, 

Helix chain) and Proof of Group (PoG) in later stages(2019 Q1 onwards, Orion chain). Existing 

�  of �12 54



miners can perform artificial intelligence algorithms calculation to obtain token rewards. In the 

early days, Ethereum protocol(Ethash) will still be used as PoW to ensure the stability of the block 

of NBAI blockchain. However, after the release of main-net PoG will be enabled. 

2.1.1.   Helix (PoW) 

At the same time that the White Paper is released, an artificial intelligence public blockchain 

loaded with smart contracts will also be released. Therefore, the first phase of the project will be 

implemented using an independent ether chain. The independent ether chain has the following 

advantages: 

• Less Traffic Delay. 

• Customized Gas, which can help to motivate miners to get profits through smart 

contracts instead of relying on gas profits from smart contracts. 

• Customized Difficulty,  which can increase the speed of generating the block, as well as 

adjust the speed of NBAI token production. 

According to varying computing abilities, each artificial intelligence node can obtain the tasks 

in the task pool through smart contracts. Then, they calculate the task, and obtain the token 

rewards after submitting the results. The hash of a smart contract is recorded in the block to 

identify the address of the task. The contract  will set out the task address, workload and work 

costs. 

However, as bitcoin has attracted most of the world’s computing power nowadays, other 

blockchain applications using the PoW consensus mechanism have found it hard to obtain enough 

hash power to protect their own safety. Mining causes a waste of a lot of resources, which will 

inevitably lead to environmental destruction and energy shortage. It is difficult to shorten the 

confirmation time of the block, and the cycle of reaching a consensus is longer, which is no longer 

suitable for popular business applications. Also, the PoW consensus mechanism has no solution to 

�  of �13 54



the 51% attack yet [7]. Therefore, we intend for the NBAI ecosystem to apply a new set of 

consensus mechanisms to address the potential loopholes in PoW and the consensus mechanism 

to optimize NBAI. 

2.1.2.   Orion(POG) 

Due to the large training data of artificial intelligence, the time taken to acquire data in the 

system becomes very crucial. The characteristic of cloud computing is the closer the distance 

between nodes, the lower the cost of communication, and the higher the corresponding 

computational efficiency. Based on this feature and the existing issues of the PoW consensus 

mechanism, we will use a new consensus mechanism — Proof of Group (PoG). In PoG we will 

use consensus systems and NBAI credit mechanisms to ensure efficiency and security. The 

definitions are as follows: 

1. Work Node and Ledger 

A work node is a main artificial intelligence computing task execution node; whose main role 

is to perform artificial intelligence computing tasks. 

In addition to the normal calculation, the ledger can also be responsible for man- aging other 

nodes and performing ledger functions. When an AI task needs to be executed, the ledger is 

responsible for allocating subtasks to all work nodes in the area. The task results are then written 

into the IPFS. The completed contract will finally be submitted through the Byzantine consensus 

to the ledger for verification. 

When a new work node joins the system, it will first broadcast the information and search for 

nearby nodes. 

• If it finds existing nodes within the response time (t), then it chooses to join the network 

of designated nodes to become one of the worker. 

• If no nodes respond within the response time (t), then it elects itself as a ledger. 

�  of �14 54



2. How to Become a Ledger 

Within a network, there are two ways for a work node to become a ledger: 

• After the disappearance of the original ledger in the network, the node with the highest 

credit automatically becomes the ledger. 

• Assume that there are n work nodes in the network, denoted as P.  The survival time of each 

node is denoted as t. If ∃pi, the product of the sum of its response time to all the other 

nodes in the network !  its survival time is the smallest, then this node becomes the 

ledger. 

3. Virtual Working Group 
 

Figure 3: Virtual Working Group 

Several work nodes will be combined into a working group. The backup factor in a working 

group is defined as the number of nodes that can simultaneously process the ledger. Assuming a 

total sum of n nodes, the backup factor can be 1 <k <n + 1; when k = n, it will convert into a Helix 

system. A backup system is a way of keeping ledger within a group. However, miners may try to 

∑
n −1

i= 1
T

�  of �15 54



increase the backup factor k artificially in order to obtain the NBAI tokens from mining. For this 

reason, the system is mainly based on AI calculations and the mining output should be lower. 

4. Communication Among Groups 
 

Figure 4: Communication Among Groups 

The working groups composes a ledger network. The network uses the Byzantine consensus 

system for joint ledger, which fully guarantees the balance between preventing 51% attacks and 

ledger efficiency. 

In Nebula AI’s Proof of Group (PoG), each participant is denoted as Pi, needs to know other 

people they think are important in the blockchain network, denoted as Pkj. A transaction 

settlement, denoted as TS, requires waiting for the vast majority of other people in the group to 

agree on any previous trade. 

Assume Pi, Pkj ∈ group G, consensus algorithm Consensus(A, B), consensus verify algorithm 

Verify(V, NL), then consensus for each node is calculated as 

�  of �16 54



Furthermore, those who are considered important are confirmed only if they are confirmed by 

their important participants. Thus, in the working group, the final consensus is calculated as: 

Eventually, when there are enough network nodes, the system will accept the transaction, and 

this series of hierarchical group consensus will make it impossible for an attacker to have complete 

consensus information and thus be unable to attack. The PoG Consensus ensures the completeness 

of AI tasks and transactional information. 

2.1.3   Task Implementation 

The task pool contains two kinds of tasks: 

• Generating tasks, such as Ethash and protein sequencing. 

• User tasks, where users submit tasks to solve certain problems, and the users will set 

the number of NBAI tokens required for tasks. Either task comes with a small smart 

contract system for submitting contracts and calculations. Mining will receive NBAI tokens 

as rewards for tasks and ledgers at the same time. 

      A standard training task includes the following: 

• Training data used by tasks, where the dataset can come from the foundation or be 

customized. 

• Training script used by tasks, where training methods come from standard RNN, 

CNN, LSTM and other customized deep learning methods. 

• NBAI tokens utilized for training tasks, where training tasks will be completed by the 

�  of �17 54



AI mining Machine, and the user must specify the amount of NBAI tokens that will be 

utilized. The higher the number of NBAI tokens utilized, the higher the training priority. 

The task system is stored on the integrated IPFS, which is stores the arithmetic encryption 

algorithm and task code. When the miner receives the computational task, it returns its own 

hardware parameters, downloads the computational task unit remotely, and trains the dataset. After 

packaging the standard distributed TensorFlow, the appropriate redundancy calculation is added to 

ensure the reliability of the calculation results. 

2.1.4.    Cross-Chain Service Usage 

As a decentralized artificial intelligence system, many components will be decentralized. 

However, designing all these components on their own is very inefficient and the system should be 

interoperable with other decentralized services and be used cross-chain. There are two types of 

cross-chain: Value Cross-Chain and Technology Cross-Chain. 

Value cross-chain is a cross-chain transaction regarding decentralized exchanges such as the 

exchange in the EtherDelta through smart contracts to obtain the required service tokens. The 

token is then used to drive the appropriate services. This technology is simple, yet it has a low 

performance. If tokens can be redeemed in advance in the system, latency will be reduced. Under 

the current conditions, USDT and Bitcoin will all be typical value cross-chain media. 

Examples of technology cross-chain include cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and 

Litecoin, which uses Segwit isolation in order to realize the cross-chain transactions between 

different currencies, as well as ongoing zero-knowledge verification transactions between Zcash 

and Ethereum. Zero-knowledge proofs make Zcash tokens untraceable by creating private 

transactions on the public Zcash blockchain.  A bottom chain needs to be designed for cross-chain 

transactions. Currently, a large number of ICO projects have attempted cross-chain. 

For example, the Polkadot project of Ethcore in the field of cross-chain communications has 

been designed with the core philosophy of addressing two main problems of blockchain 

�  of �18 54



technology diffusion and acceptance: immediate scalability and extensibility. The project is 

currently based on Ethereum to achieve its interconnection with the private chain, and treat other 

public chain network as the upgrade target. After its technology matures, the integration will 

dramatically enhance the scope and performance of the project [5]. 

Figure 5: Cross-Chain Service Usage 

2.2.   AI Data Center and Mining Machine  

2.2.1.   AI  Data Center 

To guarantee adequate AI power supply before large-scale users join, we will cooperate with 

large-scale third-party Internet data centers in Quebec. Quebec has a very competitive global 

electricity bill, a cold climate, abundant resources and 34 data centers. In addition, the world’s 

leading companies, including IBM, Nokia, Amazon and Microsoft have built data centres in 

Quebec. 

�  of �19 54



The advantages of choosing Quebec as an artificial intelligence data center are as follows: 

• Adequate Water and Low Electricity Rates  

Table 1: Quebec electricity rates 

 

According to Ontario Hydro and Hydro Québec’s statistics in 2013, Canada has the world’s 

lowest electricity rates. Among all provinces in Canada, Quebec has the lowest electricity 

rates [15], and more than 90% of the electricity use hydropower energy. 

• Lower Temperature 

Quebec has a winter of up to nine months and its average temperature in winter is below 

minus 10 degrees Celsius, even below 20 degrees Celsius in summer. Low temperature 

optimizes the heat dissipation of the equipment room. 

• Adequate AI Talents Pool 

Google, Facebook and Microsoft have set up artificial intelligence centers in Montreal,

Nova Scotia 64.69 118.55 154.46 298.09 728.98



which brought together a large number of talents in the field of artificial intelligence. For 

example, Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science and operations research at the 

University of Montreal, is the world’s top researcher of artificial intelligence. He is the head 

of the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms and one of the three founders of advanced 

machine learning in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition, the Canadian government 

also fully supports the research and development of artificial intelligence. The federal 

government has given funds of  213 million Canadian Dollars to the University of Montreal, 

while the provincial government plans to add 100 million Canadian dollars in the next five 

years as investment. 

• University Research 

Nebula AI has partnered with McGill University School of Medicine, to collaborate in joint 

research and development for the innovative use of artificial intelligence in surgery. 

2.2.2.     AI  Mining Machine 

A 1080Ti graphics card computing power is 7514 GFLOP/s. Using the Caffe framework to 

train the GoogLeNet model of 1.3 million image data on the GTX 1080Ti, the computation time of 

epoch 30 times is 19 hours and 43 minutes. The calculation time of six cards can be shortened to 

3.5 hours. 

Any mining machine that supports CUDA operations (mainly Nvidia series graphics cards) can 

be installed in the AI mining system. AI mining machines pre-installed common AI algorithms, 

such as CNN, RNN, reinforced learning, etc., as well as a large number of other commonly used 

libraries, such as TensorFlow, etc. The upgraded client included with the system, can automatically 

update the AI pre-installed support library. The first batch of computing miners will be preloaded 

with python 3.6 support libraries. The ledger client that supports Ethash is also integrated into 

the system. 

�  of �21 54



There are three types of methods to obtain rewards as NBAI tokens that are available on AI 

mining machines: 

1. Rewards from Ledger. 

The Equahash-based algorithm supports NBAI tokens from Ledger. However, the amount of 

NBAI tokens obtained here would generally be less than that obtained from AI calculation. 

2. Rewards from AI Calculation. 

The NBAI tokens obtained from AI Calculation is the most important source of obtaining 

NBAI tokens for miners. 

3. Rewards from IPFS. 

Mining machines can be turned duo-mining mode, support Sia and storj mining. IPFS can 

also be used to pay for the data storage in AI calculations. 

2.3.  DAI App Development 

 

Figure 6:  AI DAI App 

The Ethereum community calls smart-contract based applications as Decentralised 

Applications. The goal of DApp is to create a friendlier interface for the smart contract, and to add 

�  of �22 54



additional features such as IPFS. DApp can run on a centralized server that interacts with Ethereum 

nodes. Examples include the famous EtherDelta, Ethercat, etc. 

However, the current smart contracts are not enough for decentralised AI applications. The 

reasons are as follows: 

• Ethereum smart contracts do not come with AI calculations. 

EVM is a Turing complete contract virtual machine, but its consensus computing system 

can only perform simple tasks, and it is unable to perform complex artificial intelligence 

calculations. 

• Ethereum mining clients do not support the computational libraries required for AI 

calculations. 

The operation of artificial intelligence depends largely on the support of various 

development kits, and distributed computing is its main task. The supporting libraries 

required for the relevant computing tasks can be implemented with separate computing 

clients. 

However, as a commercial AI application, the blockchain hyperledger and payment function 

remains at the core of the system. Due to the scarcity of artificial intelligence computing resources, 

shared computing power will become a very useful function. Each user can link to the chain, and 

use blockchain to rent or lend computing power to complete the calculation tasks. DAI App users 

can also write standard, compliant smart contracts, according to their own needs. 

�  of �23 54



Figure 7: Deep Learning 

When training a deep learning model, two major operations are performed: forward 

propagation and backward propagation.  In forward propagation, the input is passed through the 

neural network, and after processing the input, an output is generated. Whereas in backward 

propagation, the weights of neural network are updated based on errors in forward propagation. 

One of the most critical problems in neural network training is the training speed, especially for 

deep learning, which will consume a lot of time. The computationally intensive part of a neural 

network consists of multiple matrix algorithms, and the GPU has unique advantages regarding 

matrix operations and numerical calculations. In particular, floating point and parallel 

computations can outperform the CPU by tens to hundreds of times. While using GPU to train 

deep learning models, it is also easier to classify and predict on the cloud, enabling far more data 

and throughput with less power consumption and less infrastructure occupation. Therefore, getting 

enough computing power through smart contracts for artificial intelligence calculations is an 

effective method. 

Let’s take a typical style transfer learning model (Gatys et al.)  As an example to compare the 

time that a GTX 1080 Ti GPU, K80 GPU (AWS P2), i5 7500 CPU, and CPU (AWS P2) use the 

TensorFlow framework to calculate. 

�  of �24 54



 

Figure 8: GPU vs CPU 

The GTX 1080 Ti GPU performs nearly 50 times better than the i5 7500 CPU.  

Nebula AI provides very elegant, cost-competitive computing power. Nebula AI artificial 

intelligence mining machine uses Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU. Let’s take Amazon P2.xlarge (Nvidia Tesla 

K80) as an example: In reference to market price in spring 2018, Nvidia 1080 Ti costs 803.85 US 

dollars each, other supporting hardware costs 2,000USD, the electricity costs 0.12 US dollars per 

hour, and assuming a 1080 Ti has a life span of two years, thus, equipment cost per minute is 

(803.85+2000)/ (365 × 24 × 60 × 2) = 0.00267USD, its unit computing cost per hour is 0.00267 × 

60+ 0.12 = 0.28 USD/hour. 

The above calculations give Nebula AI remarkable price advantages in comparison with 

Amazon. The official test data shows that the Nvidia 1080 Ti’s Tensorflow GPU performance is 

four times that of Amazon P2.xlarge instance [13]. According to published report by Amazon web 

services [22], the price of P2.xlarge is 0.9 US dollars/hour, this means that even in depreciated 

model, the cost/hour comparison between Nebula AI and Amazon is 0.28/0.9  = 31.1%. If we 

consider electricity only, the cost difference is estimated to be 13.3%. Other than cost difference, 

users who use Amazon or Google cloud platform need to upload their data to those servers for 

calculation, in which condition data privacy is not guaranteed, but the decentralized NBAI 

ecosystem can solve this problem. 

2.4.  Higher Education 

NBAI provides rich interfaces for scientific research in major universities around the world, 

which can significantly improve the work efficiency of researchers,  reduce R&D costs, and break 

the barriers between high-level programming needs and low-level configurations. The Platform as 

a Service (PaaS) provided by the NBAI ecosystem enables university students to focus on research 

�  of �25 54



instead of bottom configuration. 

2.5.  Nebula AI Foundation 

The Nebula AI ecosystem is expected to become a partner community using NBAI 

cryptocurrency. The Nebula Foundation aims to be an independent, non-profit, and democratic 

governing body for this ecosystem. 

A blockchain AI Foundation will be established for the promotion and education of foundational 

artificial intelligence and fund venture activities. We encourage the participation of everyone in the 

community, and the involvement in R&D interactive activities for DAI Apps to be integrated 

onto Nebula AI platform.  

Based on the principle of independence, the Foundation’s wallet address will be a secured 

multi-signature wallet.  Only 3 out of 4 signatures authorize a transaction.  Increasing the signature 

should be reviewed by the Finance and Management Committee. A large amount of tokens uses 

cold storage, while a small amount of tokens use multiple signatures. 

2.5.1.     AI  Joint  Laboratory 

Nebula AI Foundation will extend broad cooperation in the field of AI, Blockchain, 

Distributed Computing with Universities of Montreal, University of Toronto and McGill 

University. Canada is going to create new center of super-artificial intelligence in Toronto, 

Waterloo, Montreal, and Edmonton, in order to establish a sound financial, business and human 

resources-ecological chain. In 2017, the federal government’s annual budget also indicated that the 

government intends to place the development of the artificial intelligence industry as one of the 

top priorities at national level. 

The research conducted by Professor Yoshua Bengio and his team at the University of Montreal 

over the past 10 years has laid the groundwork and places Montreal at the forefront of artificial 

�  of �26 54



intelligence. Bengio also conducts academic research at the Institute of Algorithms (MILA) at the 

University of Montreal. MILA is supported by The Institute for Data Valorisation (IVADO). 

Nebula AI is actively communicating with MILA to promote collaborative research. 

The Surgical Innovation program, Department of Surgery, McGill University School of 

Medicine (North America s top medical school) and Nebula AI embarked on a research project 

about AI medical imaging supported by Mitacs. The Mitacs Project is a collaborative project 

initiated by the Canadian Information Technology and Integrated Systems Mathematics 

Organization and has been in operation for more than ten years. Jake Barralet is the leader of the 

program. 

In February 2018, R & D laboratories are set up in Silicon Valley, and we cooperate extensively 

with local universities and the industry on the application of artificial intelligence and the research 

on blockchain. 

2.5.2.    AI  Engineer Training Center 

Every successful project is inseparable from a large number of engineers. The current market 

is in a shortage of AI talents. Nebula AI collaborates with educational institutions such as the local 

ECV learning on funding and project platforms. AI scientists at Nebula AI will also serve as 

project trainers and recruit a large number of AI intern trainees, continuing to provide high-calibre 

talents for the AI industry. On January 27, 2018, the first group of students attended an AI 

Engineer training class led by Dr. Tengke Xiong. These students will become a solid R&D team 

reserve force for Nebula AI in the future. Blockchain training has also been scheduled in the 

program, which will take place in mid-May 2018.

3.    NBAI Architecture Design 

3.1.   NBAI Logical architecture 

Figure 9: System Logic Diagram 

The logical structure of NBAI is mainly composed of industry application requirements, 

developers, DAI App, infrastructure and Nebula AI. Nebula AI provides PaaS (Platform as a 

Service) and NBAI blockchain. A large number of artificial intelligence development needs in 

industries such as finance, healthcare and biology have prompted developers to develop DAI Apps 

for different industry applications, and provide solutions by deploying applications. Nebula AI will 

provide a wealth of interfaces and applications for developers. The decentralized blockchain 

provided by NBAI, in conjunction with the Nebula AI credit mechanism, will address the issue of 

P2P trust and big data processing for sensitive data and models.

3.2.   NBAI System Architecture 
 

Figure 10: System Architecture 

The system architecture of NBAI is mainly composed of NBAI, developers, users, trading 

centers, miners and task pools. Nebula AI not only provides a decentralized NBAI blockchain, it 

also offers cross-chain token exchanges to improve the value exchange in the NBAI ecosystem. 

�  of �29 54



 

Figure 11: Shared AI Cloud Computing Platform 

Nebula AI provides a shared AI cloud computing platform, and PaaS (Platform as a Service) 

enables non-IT sector practitioners to achieve rapid development and deployment, and reduce 

the dependence on the system environment and computing power. 

3.3.   API/SDK Support 

Some common prepaid, retainage smart contracts can be generated programmatically using the 

SDK, and the APIs provide interfaces in a centralized service. The first batch of supported SDKs 

uses python as the main programming language, followed by java and .NET. With the support of 

the SDK, users can programmatically drive AI calculations more conveniently and become an 

interface point with the centralized system.

4. NBAI Optimized Design 

4.1     Data Security Encryption 

Data will be saved using homomorphic encryption. The idea of homomorphic encryption 

refers to the operation of encrypting several data and then deciphering the result, which is 

consistent with the result of performing an operation when these data are not encrypted. The 

current homomorphic encryption schemes can be divided into three types: partial homomorphism, 

somewhat homomorphism and fully homomorphism. Partial homomorphism can only realize a 

certain kind of algebra (or, multiply, add). The somewhat homomorphism can realize a finite 

number of additions and multiplications simultaneously. Full homomorphism realizes any number 

of additions and multiplications. Homomorphic encryption scheme can only realizes the 

encryption function, but can also be used for cipher text data calculation. 

Let  <  G, ∗ >  <  H, o  >  be  two  algebraic  systems,  f  : G  −→ H  is  a  mapping. If ∀a, b ∈ G, f 

(a ∗ b) = f (a)of (b), then f is a homomorphic mapping from G to H. Encryption is a mapping from 

plaintext to cipher text space. If the crypto map is a homomorphic map, we say that it is a 

homomorphic encryption scheme. We give the following definitions: 

Let E(K, x) denote the encryption of x using the encryption algorithm E and the encryption key 

K. F represents an operation. For E and F, there exists an efficient algorithm G: 

E = (K, F (x1, ..., xn)) = G(K, F, (E(x1, ..., xn))) (3) 

Then the encryption algorithm E is said to be homomorphic for F. 

If the definition of the equation only holds for  

Then the encryption scheme is an additive homomorphic encryption scheme.

If the definition of the equation only holds for

�  of �31 54



Then the encryption scheme is an multiplication homomorphic encryption scheme.

An encryption scheme is a fully homomorphic encryption scheme if the equality in the 

definition holds for F (x1, ..., xn), which contains a mixture of addition and multiplication 

operations. 

The homomorphic encryption scheme that only holds for one kind of operation is called the 

partially homomorphic encryption scheme. 

The homomorphic encryption scheme ε of the public key system consists of 3 random 

algorithms  KeyGenε, Encryptε and Decryptε. 

• KeyGenε: Receive the safety factor λ as input, output the private key sk and the public key 

pk, pk defines the plaintext space P and ciphertext space X. 

• Encryptε: Receive input pk and plaintext π ∈ P , and output cipher text ψ ∈ X, encrypted 

with plaintext π with public key pk, denoted as ψ = Encryptε(pk, π). 

• Decryptε: Receive the input sk and ψ, output the plaintext π. 

The computational complexity of the above three random algorithms is determined by the 

polynomial of λ, and the encryption system should satisfy the correctness  condition:  

if (sk, pk) R⃖ KeyGenε(λ),      and π ∈ P,  φ R⃖ Encryptε(pk,π),  then  Decryptε(sk, φ) = π.  

In addition, the Evaluateε algorithm is interpreted as: Entering a public key pk, a circuit C from 

the circuit set Cε and a set of ciphertext Y =< ψ1, ..., ψt >, output the ciphertext ψ ∈ C. If  

                   ψi = Evaluateε(pk, πi), i = 1, ..., t,                 

Then:  

Evaluateε(pk, Y, C) = Evaluateε(pk, C(π1, ..., πt) (4) 

Once the algorithm is preserved, the data structure is preserved. Therefore, in the process of machine 

learning, we only need the data structure, we can decrypt the encrypted information and machine learning. 

�  of �32 54



4.2    Distributed System Optimization 

Data transmission can be sped up by the equal segmentation of big data processing. The 

worker node on NBAI receives the task for concurrent processing, after which each node returns 

the result to the selected aggregation node for the task’s consolidation, and finally returns the task 

owner. In these transmissions and processing, we optimize NBAI by node election, data access, 

load balancing, network security and the research of redundancy mechanisms. 

When NBAI receives AI tasks with large datasets from developers, single miners cannot 

handle the tasks on their own. We will need to split the tasks and deliver them to multiple miners 

for calculation, and eventually return the aggregated task results to the developer. This series of 

operations needs to rely on a complete and optimized distributed system. NBAI will also be 

optimized to meet the performance demands of high throughput, low latency and high 

concurrency. 

Although the traditional distributed system structure has only three layers, according to 

business demands, it will often be designed to more levels. A multi-tier structure often has a wide 

range of proxy processing and routing. Most of these proxy processes are connected via TCP to 

both ends. However, in order to avoid the high failure rate and high maintenance cost of TCP, 

NBAI will apply message queuing mechanisms to realize inter-process communications. 

NBAI uses NoSQL to provide a solution to the distribution of data storage tiers, In addition to 

the advantages of high-volume and high-speed access, NoSQL can only retrieve and write using an 

index. This constraint brings the advantages of distributed implementation, the system can press 

this main index to define the data stored in the process. Such a big data-level task, can be safely 

sent to different nodes. 

�  of �33 54



Figure 12: Future/Promise Model 

Because distributed systems involve a great deal of network communications and the system 

relies on asynchronous, non-blocking programming models, developers generate a large number 

of callback functions in the programming of distributed systems. Task instructions will be 

distributed to multiple processes, and completed through a combination of network 

communications. However, this asynchronous programming model callback is very detrimental to 

code maintenance. In order to solve this problem, NBAI uses the Future/Promise model to 

optimize the callback function. 

5. NBAI Token 

5.1   Token Plan 

5.1.1      Use Value of  Tokens 

The NBAI token is used to purchase computing power. When the training data is relatively 

small, the number of tokens consumed is less, and when the training data is large, the token 

consumed increases accordingly. The number of NBAI tokens used depends on the training 

costs(time and computing power consumed for specific task) and the value of the current token . 

The current value of token is the hash power of each 1080Ti graphics card within one minute, that 

is, 7514 GFLOP/s × 60. 

5.1.2   Token application 

Tokens will be used in the following three cases: 

• Developers Test 

�  of �34 54



Developers in the test will utilize some tokens for model training. Depending on how many 

tokens are utilized, the training time required to train the model will be reduced by 50% to 

90%. 

• Use of DAI APPs 

DAI APPs may be set as paid apps by developers; users must utilize the NBAI tokens in 

exchange for these AI services, such as the trend prediction of cryptocurrencies app in this 

White Paper. 

• Purchase of DAI training services 

When users utilize training services to obtain finer models, they are required to pay for 

retraining the models. 

5.1.3    User scenarios 

1. Quantitative Trading 

Quantitative trading has been using computers for assistance from many years ago. Analysts 

use a variety of quantitative models to design metrics and observe data distribution, using the 

computer as an operator. Until the rise of machine learning in recent years, the data can be rapidly 

and quantitatively analyzed, fitted, and predicted, so that analysts can predict the market trend of 

future financial products more accurately. However, the calculations of these models still require a 

lot of artificial intelligence computing power. With the traditional approach, each trading section 

needs to set up a data center on its own. However, sharing computing power can eliminate the need 

for expensive maintenance, and allow financial trading firms to focus more on predicting itself. 

2. AI Learners Program 
Colleges and universities have increasingly set up artificial intelligence courses, which will 

become more popular in the next few years. Students usually choose small tasks to run on their 

computers, and run time-consuming tasks in the school computer labs. However, these fragmented 

tasks can be solved with blockchain computing cloud. Low-cost AI computing services are ideal 

for students to complete a variety of computing tasks, and to quickly modify their models. 

�  of �35 54



3. Biomedical Artificial Intelligence 
 

Figure 13: AI for Cancer Research 

Early detection of tumours is of great significance. However, because of the small area of early 

cancer lesions, the traditional method is difficult to judge whether the tumour is benign or 

malignant, which makes it difficult for clinical diagnosis. Doctors often need to conduct tests 

using the biopsy method, which not only increases the medical cost but also brings patients great 

pain. The application of artificial intelligence in medical image recognition and multidisciplinary 

collaborative diagnosis can effectively overcome this difficult point, enhance the ability of doctors 

to diagnose, help to make quick decisions and promote the transformation of medical services to 

one of individualization and precision. 

5.2   DAI App Developer profit model 

1. DAI App Task Types 

• Class I — Require training model. 

App users have to utilize tokens to drive calculations that consume a lot of resources. The 

training time may take hours or even hundreds of hours. 

• Class II — No need to train models or use existing models. 

�  of �36 54



The Apps do not need to consume computing power, users only need to pay a certain NBAI 

tokens for smart contract costs. It is also possible to invoke the computing results of Class I 

DAI Apps to generate the application. This type of DAI Apps is less expensive. 

2. Task Calculation 

A standard computing contract contains the following basic elements: 

• AI task data address 

• AI task program script 

• AI task execution result output address 

• The number of NBAI tokens required for AI task  

3. Task Release 

When the task is posted on the chain, all AI miners can accept tasks from the system. The task 

is identified as “in progress” when it is executed by the mining machine. The user can set several 

different levels of redundancy calculations to ensure a more accurate result. Nounce can be set to 

different levels such as 1, 2, 3 to correspond to different redundancy calculations. Larger numbers 

mean more calculations are needed to ensure the accuracy of the results. The corresponding cost 

will be higher. 

4. Cost Calculation 

AI calculation is generally divided into the training phase and the using phase. The 

training phase will consume a lot of training resources, a n d  most of the computational power 

will be used here. In the using phase, due to the end of the training, less power will be 

consumed. At the start of the task, the smart contracts will pre-charge a portion of the NBAI 

tokens as pre-payment and, at the end of the calculation, will re-calculate the total NBAI 

tokens utilized and require the customer to pay the balance of NBAI tokens to obtain the data. 

The users need a certain amount of NBAI tokens to start booking service, multi-signature 

automatic contracts will lock the NBAI tokens to ensure the transaction being operated 

�  of �37 54



normally. 

5. Task Execution 

The mining machine clients read the task plans from the chain and parse them into executable 

AI code. Artificial intelligence and training data can be stored in external links when tasks start 

being executed. The code will be executed in the following steps: 

• Parse the encryption task. 

• Download data remotely. 

• Set the task to execute state. 

• Write the progress and result of the operation. 

• Mining machine binds address for rewards. 

6. Calculation Ends 

DApp users download the results of the implementation, which can be used directly for the 

web demo or offline use. Execution results can be obtained by API method, and be used after 

decrypting. 

5.3.  NBAI AI Application Case 

Hedge funds, banks and large international companies like Goldman Sachs are benefiting from 

smart-technology-based foreign exchange and stock trading. These companies predict the short-

term and long-term effects of various financial markets through “deep learning” —

mathematically-based predictive and probabilistic models which evolve continuously. 

Cryptocurrency players such as Pantera Capital, and financial institutions including Santander and 

Citibank, are also looking at making money from cryptocurrencies. Designing an artificial 

intelligence model requires a large amount of computing power. Each user must compute the 

model each time when the parameters are adjusted. At this point, getting enough computing power 

through smart contracts for artificial intelligence computing is an effective method. The standard 

�  of �38 54



system goes through the following steps:

8. ICO Plan 

The initial release is 6.7 NBAI billion tokens. Each year, it is intended for a certain amount of 

tokens to be produced, with the amount decreasing in six years from 2% to 0.2% of the total initial 

number of NBAI tokens released(6.7 billions). Tokens are consumed when users use customized 

predictive features of artificial intelligence, and the amount of tokens consumed depends on the 

amount of computation. The demand of tokens will increase along with the increasing complexity 

�  of �40 54



or better performance for AI tasks,  in which condition higher computation power will be 

consumed. 

Miners obtain tokens through mining, and AI mining machines are the main sources of mining 

returns. Any application based on the NBAI’s blockchain (such as quantitative trading, Biomedical 

AI) can only be paid by NBAI tokens. 

Tokens are ERC 20 tokens, and will be replaced by Nebula AI main chain tokens in the ratio of 

1:1 in the future. 

Public offering is 1 Ethereum = 100,000 NBAI.  

ICO softcap: 5,000 Ethereum. 

Private placement starts from January 22, 2018, and ends on March 30, 2018. 

The private placement hardcap: 18,000 Ethereum. 

Public offering starts within one month after the end of private placement. The 

public offering hardcap: 12,000 Ethereum. 

Unsold tokens from private placement will be merged into public offering. Unsold tokens of 

public offering will be completely destroyed. 

For token investors that participate in the private placement and public offering, there will be 

no token lockup period. 

The tokens held by the foundation will be frozen after crowdfunding ends and are released in 

18 stages (across a time period of approximately 3 years), every 60 days for a cycle, and 1/18 of 

the foundation holdings will be released each time. 

After the public offering, NBAI tokens will gradually be listed on global cryptocurrency

10. Conclusion 

As the world’s first AI blockchain system, Nebula AI is dedicated to driving the advancement 

of artificial intelligence technologies, building a credible trust-based blockchain, creating social 

value and serving all of humanity. NBAI builds the next generation of AI blockchain infrastructure 

platform that enables developers in many industries to truly develop, compute and deploy artificial 

intelligence with high efficiency, low cost, safely and reliably, without worrying about the 

underlying development, system configuration and environment setup. 

NBAI can be considered as a consensus system for decentralized data. As the value carrier, 

NBAI tokens realize the value flow of artificial intelligence in the NBAI ecosystem. Whilst the 

traditional Internet connection can solve the problem of data communication, NBAI further 

solves the problem of data consensus on the basis of traditional Internet. Compared to a large, 

centralized platform, NBAI can avoid data being stored or stolen by service providers and realize 

the public processing tasks while ensuring data privacy. 

The rapid development of blockchain technology has made it possible to realize the digital 

credit society. NBAI will inject more fresh and vibrant blood into the development of global 

blockchain technology and look forward to pushing artificial intelligence, an important area where 

society can change, to new heights.
