1. Executive Summary

1.1 The Problem
Digital payments are expected to be a US$3.6 Trillion industry in 2018, growing at a CAGR of 13.5% 
through 20221. The majority of this growth is a result of a surge in digital content and e-commerce, 
however, the market is changing quickly as commerce shifts to smartphones, the number of consumers 
in emerging markets overtake developed markets, and blockchain technology decentralizes everything. 
The incumbent stores for content and commerce have failed the small independent sellers with their 
monopolistic policies:

  The top 1% of content developers dominate 94% of the total revenues on Apple app store2;

  App and e-commerce store fees and marketing fees leave merchants with less than 50% of net revenues;

  Most app stores and e-commerce stores only accept international credit cards however this excludes 
the largest and fastest growing regions and emerging markets, representing up to 85% of the world’s 
population;

  App stores and e-commerce sites have unfair policies for merchants: 2 weeks to 3 months to get paid 
on sales; the only payment methods available are PayPal and bank transfers, chargeback fees, high 
foreign exchange charges, and bad debt fees passed through3.

1.2 Solution
The Bezant Blockchain is a Service platform providing Content developers and e-commerce merchants a 
disruptive way to sell to customers by:

  Allowing anyone to setup their own Content or Commerce store and send/receive payments from 
anywhere in the world using local payment methods.

  Proving the BZNT token which will serve as the native cryptocurrency and medium of exchange within 
the Bezant platform which will eliminate expensive Store fees (30%) and provides instant P2P payments 
to merchants.

  Targeting up to 1,000 transactions per second using Bezant’s blockchain. This would enable the Bezant 
to process more than 2x all of the paid apps sold across all app stores in 2017, globally.

Bezant’s goal is to serve as an online end-to-end distribution and payment platform for global buyers 
and sellers. Therefore, we plan to provide payment solutions to e-commerce markets for goods and 
service marketplaces, like Amazon, Taobao, etc., and digital content stores, like Google Play, and other 
third-party app stores. We believe that our strengths are in being able to: 1) Diversify and create another 
distribution market for digital content and e-commerce, 2) Reduce costs and charges to both customers 
and merchants by disrupting digital payments; and 3) Provide inclusion to the largest and fastest growing 
market in the world, the emerging markets.

An e-commerce transaction refers to a commercial transaction that is conducted electronically on the 
internet, and market refers to a digital platform that supports such transaction. Such market has increased 
in both number of transactions and volume as technology has enabled both desktop and mobile access 
to e-commerce market. Worldwide e-commerce sales are expected to grow by 246.2% to $4.5 trillion by 
2021 and this trend is expected to continue globally4.

The e-commerce market has well been established among many of developed and emerging countries 
while China has already become the biggest market, globally5. Such success in China is a result of 
technological advancement, especially in digital payments, like Alipay, and marketplaces, like JD.com and 
Taobao, etc. Such growth is expected in  South East Asia, which is the world’s fastest growing internet 
region (14% five-year CAGR) and expected to reach 480 million users by 2020. South East Asia’s internet 
economy is expected to grow to ~$200+ billion by 20256.

7  Statista, Most popular payment methods of online shoppers worldwide as of 2016, by region

Across different regions, different payment methods are prevalent according to regional local payment 
methods7. At the same time, the most popular online payment method globally is still credit cards, 
whereas digital payment systems have started to gain more attention especially from China. Cash on 
delivery resulting from unbanked end users and lack of payment infrastructure, is still a major payment 
method in many of emerging markets, which indicates that there are more opportunities for alternative 
payment methods.

8  Digital Content and App Stores5  Statista, App stores - Statistics & Facts
9  AppAnnie, App Store Revenue Forecast: $139 Billion by 2021
10  AppAnnie, Top Predictions for the App Economy in 2018

An app store or app marketplace is a type of digital distribution platform for mobile and desktop apps. 
Android and Apple’s iOS are the two leading operating systems for mobile platforms: Apple’s App Store 
and Google Play, the official app store for the Android OS8.  In 2017, the two stores combined accounted 
for 75% of total app store revenues, globally9. 

Other prominent app stores in the Android market include Windows Store, Amazon Appstore, and 
Blackberry World. By the end of October 2017, the iOS App Store and Google Play had more than 2 million 
and more than 3.5 million apps available, respectively. Furthermore, new apps continue to be introduced 
at an exponential rate; during the month ending October 31, 2017, roughly 50,000 new apps launched on 
the iOS App Store and over 150,000 were added to Google Play10. 

The demand for digital content market, represented by downloads and usage, is increasing at a significant 
pace. Year over year, in Q3 2017, downloads for iOS and Google Play combined reached nearly 26 billion 
worldwide, growing more than 8% and total time spent in apps worldwide among Android phone users 
grew 40%, coming close to 325 billion hours. 

As a result, consumer spending on digital content is increasing significantly. In 2016, consumers around 
the world spent about $62 billion in app stores. In 2017, app store revenues are forecasted to grow US$81 
billion and in 2018, such revenue - consumer spend - across all mobile app stores will grow approximately 
30% year over year to exceed $110 billion. Such growth is expected to continue. Worldwide app store 
downloads are expected to exceed 352 billion in 2021 with gross consumer spend across all app stores 
to surpass $139 billion.

East Asian countries like China and Indonesia, are significantly driving the growth of digital content 
market. Among those countries, dramatic changes in China and other Southeast Asian countries are 
noticeable, where lower-priced Android devices are popular with the burgeoning middle class. Such trend 
will continue to drive the majority of growth. It is forecasted that by 2021, China alone will generate over 
$56 billion in app store spend — 40% of global annual revenue.

11  VisionMobile, The Evolving State of Mobile Commerce Report

Inaccessibility: Two billion adults worldwide are unbanked and some of the lowest rates of financial 
penetration are in emerging markets. Only 20% of the adults in Vietnam and Thailand have savings at 
a financial institution. As such, access to traditional financial services and access to e-commerce and 
digital platforms are limited due to unstable physical and digital infrastructures. 

Limited Opportunities: As the world is getting more integrated through globalization, the goods 
and services market has begun to make an impact on different geographies. Sellers in United States 
were limited to their local markets, where the upside potential is limited due to slowing growth. Sellers in 
developed markets have limitations in selling to large and fast growing emerging markets primarily due 
to limited payment option.

Foreign Transactions: As the world is getting more integrated through globalization, the goods 
and services market has begun to make impacts to different geographies. Nowadays, selling goods 
internationally faces systemic inefficiencies in the e-commerce market due to limited services and 
payments in foreign currencies that are difficult to handle.

High Transaction Costs: Apple Store and Google Play have multiple inefficiencies and this has 
discouraged many developers who are now seeking for better solutions. App stores, for instance, take  
30% of app revenue and after other service fees from intermediaries, net can be less than 50% of revenue. 
Moreover, lack of marketing channels within the markets is also a concern for many developers. Smaller 
developers are put into a situation where they have to spend heavily on user acquisition, making it difficult 
for them to thrive.

System Integration: According to VisionMobile, approximately 66% of developers have cited ease 
of integration as a critical factor and due to the risk of transaction processing and security concerns, they 
have to use well-known marketplaces although other restrictions are severe on those markets. It is cited 
that such integration issue is more important by the majority of developers than cost issue11.

Access to New Markets: Emerging markets are home to 85% of the global population; 2.5 billion 
people in China and India alone represent more than a third of the world’s population. Close to 90% of 
people under 30 reside within the emerging markets and this is also the age segment that accounts for 
the most online transactions (approx. 75%). Traditionally unserved market participants in many emerging 
markets will get an access to goods and services throughout the globe through the Jehmi platform and 
developed markets’ sellers, who need more buyers, will be able to target a broadened audience.

3.3 Market Failures and Opportunities
3.3.1 Market Failures:

3.3.2 Opportunities: 



14

Mobile Penetration and Payment: With rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, 
the FinTech Revolution had a big impact on the emerging markets. Exponential growth in mobile phone 
penetration has driven such revolution to be efficient and effective,  now exceeding 100% in many of 
emerging countries like Brazil with 141 handsets per 100 people, India and China with mobile penetration 
rates of 84.6% and 76%. While most transactions in emerging markets are still being made in cash, the 
shift to electronic and digital methods is happening rapidly with higher mobile penetration rate. For 
instance, in Indonesia, only 31% of transactions are conducted using non-cash methods with the number 
of cashless transactions growing at an annual rate of 23%. Non-cash mobile payment in emerging Asia is 
growing by 22% owing to increasing internet use and the adoption of mobile payments.

Transaction and International Fees: Handling of foreign currencies and transactions as well as 
minimizing intermediary fees can be improved through the use of blockchain technology. International 
transfer fees and foreign exchange fees eliminated at banks and digital payment methods can be 
eliminated. 

System Integration: New payment methods that can provide value-added services that are developer- 
friendly will be able to gain traction in the large global market for digital payments. There is a myriad of 
payment systems throughout the world and the ability to aggregate and integrate these together will 
create an enormous opportunity. 

Security: The most-important feature of digital payments has been and always will be security. 
Blockchain technology through decentralized nodes, multiple validations, and permanent ledger entries, 
has revolutionized how any type of transaction can be secured. 

Rise of social commerce: The rise of social commerce and increase of small mobile commerce 
platforms have flourished globally with the ubiquity of social media. According to Instagram, in December 
of 2017, their monthly active users have reached 800 million and such large user base has created a 
flourishing industry of small merchants using Instagram to advertise and sell their products. Such 
merchants, requiring digital payment system, can easily utilize our solution in any market.

Bezant’s blockchain platform consists of both a blockchain and a service platform that work together 
to provide Service partners (SPs) with a dynamic blockchain-based payment platform to create new 
services. Bezant is targeting SPs with significant user and subscriber traffic across many industries: 
game publishing, e-commerce, music and video streaming, communications, social networking, and 
media channels.

4.2 Bezant Blockchain
The Bezant blockchain will be created using the Hyperledger fabric technology as a starting point, which 
provides a distributed ledger technology (DLT) enabling enterprise-ready network security, scalability, 
confidentiality, and performance, in a modular blockchain architecture. 
     
The Basic workflow of transaction on the proposed Bezant blockchain:

0) Assumption: User has downloaded Client and registered with Organization (channel) 
1) Client A initiates a transaction proposal and sends this to multiple peers on the channel; 
2) Endorsing peers verify (sign) the proposal transaction and submit to the Client A;  
3) Client sends endorsed Proposals to Orderer as a transaction; 
4)  An orderer receives proposed ledger updates concurrently from many different applications in the 

network on a particular channel and packages these into blocks; 
5)  The final phase of the transaction workflow involves the distribution and subsequent validation of 

blocks from the orderer to the peers, where they can be applied to the ledger.



17

2) User Client (Application)

The client is an SDK for authentication and communication and is required for access to the Bezant 
blockchain. It represents the entity that acts on behalf of an end user. It must connect to a peer for 
communicating with the blockchain. The User client can request transactions, execute queries, and 
retrieve specific data. The User client will use an API to support Android, iOS and PC environments.

3) Peers

A blockchain network is formed from peer nodes, each of which can hold copies of ledgers and copies of 
smart contracts. A peer is a host for ledgers and chaincodes therefore, applications interact with peers 
to access resources.  A peer also receives state updates in the form of blocks from the Orderers and 
maintains the state and the ledger.

4) Orderers

Orderers form a block by sorting the validated transactions from the Client and is responsible for 
distribution throughout the blockchain. This is the only cluster-based service provided in the blockchain 
and provides for continuous and uninterrupted service. As the Bezant blockchain service does not require 
mining on a public blockchain, it deals with real-time transactions based on trusted users. Therefore, it 
can deal with significantly higher throughput and lower fees (or no fees) than existing cryptocurrency 
blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

1) Identity Authentication Service (IAS)

The Bezant blockchain is based on a private and permissioned network, therefore an Identity Authentication 
Service will be required. Rather than an open system that allows unknown identities to participate in the 
network (requiring protocols like Proof of Work to validate transactions and secure the network), the End 
users of the Bezant network must enroll through a Identity Authentication Service (IAS). The Bezant 
blockchain’s key role will be to provide Partners the ability to accommodate a vast number of unique 
users in multiple channels simultaneously accessing the blockchain.

18

On top of this blockchain, the Bezant service platform will provide a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) 
system design, which will allow Service Partners to create dynamic blockchain-based services for their 
users. 

There are primarily two types of users for the service platform: 1) Enterprise users and 2) Individual 
end users who indirectly use the platform via Service Partners. The number of users on the blockchain 
and platform will increase as the Bezant network of Partners grows. The Bezant blockchain will provide 
multiple authentication services for each user and will create multiple channels to help ensure that there 
are no security problems.

The key attribute of the Bezant blockchain service will be efficient processing. Since the blockchain is 
based on a permissioned network, all participants are known and trusted, therefore, fewer levels of trust 
and verification are required across node types, and network scalability and performance are optimized.

Jehmi Wallet will provide a hard wallet function where the user can transfer Bezants to a hard wallet such 
as Trezor, in order for a safe storage of Bezants offline.

4.4.5 Hard Wallet

4.4.4 Exchange

One of the features of the Jehmi Wallet is to provide a link to an external cryptocurrency exchange for the 
Bezant token to be convertible into another cryptocurrency. The exchange feature would be integrated into 
the Wallet UI in order to provide for a seamless withdrawal of the Bezant token into the user’s exchange 
cryptocurrency wallet in any coin or token of their choice.

4.4.3 Transfers

Similar to the payment function, Jehmi Wallet users will be able to make transfers in either their local 
currencies, foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies or by Bezant tokens. When sending Bezant tokens to 
another Jehmi Wallet, the sender avoids paying any transfer fees. Sending other forms of currencies will 
be subject to transfer fees. 

4.4.2 Purchases and Payments

The Jehmi wallet will allow customers to purchase both digital and physical goods in their local currencies 
providing a convenient payment system. This is especially ideal in emerging markets where credit cards 
are not commonly available to make purchases for things like mobile games on app stores requiring 
credit card payments. In addition to the local payment options available in the Jehmi Wallet, users will 
have the option of paying in Bezant tokens in the Jehmi Wallet. The advantage of paying in Bezant tokens 
is that when sending to another Jehmi Wallet, there are no transfer fees. This provides a strong incentive 
to users to adopt Bezant token as the main currency on the off-chain network.

4.4.1 Top-up

Jehmi wallet will provide the most-comprehensive payment options to users in order to top-up their 
wallets: e-wallets, SMS and direct carrier billing, prepaid cards, bank transfers and cash payments, and 
cryptocurrencies. The wallet service enables local payments on a global scale. When the user tops up 
their account their balance will appear as an amount in their local currency.

4.5.3 Billing & Payment

Jehmi Payment Platform is the back-end solution to the Jehmi Wallet. The Jehmi payment platform 
solves the key problems in digital payments faced by sellers: limited payment options and high fees. 
The Jehmi Payment Platform consists of two main products: Jehmi Pay and Jehmi Wallet, which work 
together to plug in and power the payment gateways for e-commerce and content stores. 

Jehmi Pay is an enterprise (B2B) platform that consists of a Billing & Payment module that 1) powers 
the Jehmi Wallet for end users; and 2) provides payment solutions for companies through the Jehmi Pay 
API.  The primary objective of Jehmi Pay is to provide a complete digital solution for local payments; local 
payment is a term that refers to leading payment methods that prevail in a certain country that may or 
may not be unique to that region.

Jehmi’s API gives content and e-commerce developers complete access to Jehmi’s Billing & Payment 
technologies and modules, facilitating the consolidation of the seller’s account in one easy-to-use API for 
credit cards, alternate payment methods, and cryptocurrencies; and our own native token, Bezant. 

Jehmi Pay’s billing solution is an efficient and scalable billing system that will be customized to support 
native mileages/rewards points, eBook services, App stores, music services, and e-commerce. The core 
features of this module will be aimed at providing an intuitive and customizable customer checkout and 
payment system. The objective of the billing platform is to help sellers maximize revenues by providing 
these main features: content and product management, registration, revision, cancellation, receipt, 
account balancing, and management. 

The Payment platform in Jehmi Pay aggregates and integrates hundreds of alternative payment methods 
and payment gateways from around the world. This allows a seller of content or products to be able to use 
one payment solution, Jehmi Pay, to sell across the globe, transcending the payment limitations found in 
emerging markets. Jehmi Pay will provide the most-comprehensive payment options to users: e-wallets,

SMS and direct carrier billing, prepaid cards, bank transfers and cash payments, and cryptocurrencies, 
including our own native token, Bezant. 

Payments will also be optimized for each country’s local payment methods to provide convenience to 
customers when making purchases while increasing revenues for sellers. For example, if sellers have 
different items selling in different countries, a simple solution will provide for different pricing in different 
markets with local currencies automatically applied.

4.5.4 Security

Security of transactions and Fraud protection will be the most-important feature of the Jehmi payment 
platform. Our team draws on its experience having worked at leading online and mobile platforms at 
Kakao, eBay, and NHN. We use a variety of security solutions to protect our systems, apply measures to 
protect server, client, network, and data, and operate AML and FDS for reliable operation of service.

The first service offering on the Bezant service platform will be Jehmi Content Platform: a white-labeled 
platform service that connects 1) Content Providers, 2) Distribution Partners, and 3) End users so that 
they can create a better ecosystem for the delivery of digital content such as games, music, and e-books 
that will provide for a disruptive solution to the incumbent app stores. 

Decentralization of many of the functions of the Content Platform through the application of blockchain 
technology will alter the paradigms of company-controlled marketplaces by providing transparent security, 
trust, privacy, lower transaction costs, and integrity. 

The greatest advantage of these decentralized platforms is the blockchain technology itself. As a 
blockchain - think of a ledger or database that contains a history of all transactions that take place on the 
platform - the platforms are completely auditable by all participants. This leads to fairer pricing for clients, 
as all prices are visible and verifiable. Potential customers are able to select the provider that best suits 
their needs, both financially and practically.

4.6.2 Billing & Payment Platform

The Billing & Payment platform provides for the same services as discussed above in the Jehmi Pay 
platform. It is built into the Content Platform and licensed to Content Developers and Distribution Partners. 
Here, the Billing & Payment Platform is customized for the specific features related to digital content and 
e-commerce: 

a) In-app purchases
With some apps, you can buy additional content or services within the app, referred to as “in-app 
purchases”. There are four types of in-app purchases available on app stores; 1) consumable (used once, 
are depleted e.g. in-game currency), 2) non-consumable (purchased once and do not expire e.g. books or 
expansion in a game), 3) auto-renewal subscriptions (access to services or periodically updated content, 
such as monthly access to cloud storage where users are charged on a recurring basis until cancelled), 
and 4) non auto-renewal subscriptions (access to services or content for a limited duration).  In-app 
purchases  account for the largest portion of sales in app stores and require a significant level of flexibility 
in design. The module will provide for geographic-specific prices and have access to hundreds of price 
points across all currencies. Content providers can set the prices they find suitable for subscribers in 
different markets.

 Consumable apps (digital item purchases)
 In order to support digital item purchases, a feature for copyright protection will be required. When 
a copyright owner creates and registers content via Jehmi’s digital item purchase module using 
blockchain technology,  the purchase history of the user will be proved and the technology to ensure 
transaction history and transparent revenue distribution will be provided.

 Subscriptions
 Subscriptions are used primarily for content services such as music and movie services and support 
one-time payments and automatic recurring payments. One-time payments work very much like in-
app purchases and automatic payments support automatic billing at regular intervals, depending on 
the product.

b) E-commerce payments
Jehmi’s billing & payment system is a flexible solution that can be adopted for the payment of all types 
of physical products through the Jehmi API module. E-commerce services can use Jehmi’s API in order 
to accept local payment methods, including the Bezant token, and provide global payment services and 
reduced fees anywhere in the world. 

4.6.1 Content Distribution

The Jehmi content platform aims to provide a white-labeled solution for media companies, portals, large 
corporations, social media influencers, et al. with a complete front and back end solution that will enable 
them to sell directly to their customers and not have to rely on the incumbent app stores.



25

4.6.4 Business Intelligence Platform

The Jehmi Business intelligence provides valuable information sourced from the Marketing platform so 
that it can be shared with all users within the Jehmi Content Distribution Platform. Based on the big data 
occurred by Content Providers, Distribution Partners, End Users, Payment Gateways via Jehmi’s various 
platforms, the solution provides user demographic information, user pattern analysis, app usability 
analysis, revenue analysis, and customer analysis.

4.6.3 Marketing Platform

In Jehmi’s marketing platform, Content Providers(CP) can more efficiently promote their services through 
the use of big data integrated into the content platform. The marketing platform will assist the Content 
Providers to promote their applications in broader marketing channels using in-app advertisements 
integrated with Jehmi-affiliated external advertisement channels. Also, a Content Provider can use Jehmi 
Marketing platform to add in-app advertisements for additional sources of revenue.

Distribution Partners(DP) can operate various types of marketing campaigns as more efficient marketing 
channels to maximize profit. Jehmi’s marketing platform is developed through the following four modules:

 Data Analytics
 In the content platform, both the DP and CP can obtain information on user data within the platform. 
With this analytics data, an algorithm recommends certain content that matches the users’ unique 
profiles in order to show content that would most-likely appeal to users and thus lead to subsequent 
purchases. 

 Marketing Tools
 After content exposure to users through big data based optimization, if the Content Provider wishes 
to continue to promote their content, they can use the marketing tool provided by Jehmi Marketing 
tools module to have control over their own marketing campaigns.

 External Advertising Platforms
 In order to optimize the marketing experience for both DPs and CPs, the Jehmi Marketing platform will 
integrate and link with 3rd party advertising platforms. The goal is to provide a seamless experience 
so that content provider can easily add in-app advertisements.

8.1 Participation

8.2 Transfer of ETH

8. Participation in the Token Sale

(a) All participants are required to register on bezant.io to submit relevant KYC documents for approval 
by BZF team prior to the public sale. KYC documents will include proof of identity and proof of residence. 
Further documents might be required in certain cases. KYC is required to prevent BZNT, BZF or Jehm 
from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering or terrorism 
financing activities. All prospective participants who are interested in participating in the Token Sale 
must carefully read this document in its entirety. Information contained or linked on bezant.io is not 
incorporated by reference into this document and is not a part of this document. 

(b) If a participant fails to provide the requested information to complete the KYC checks or does not meet 
the requirements of the KYC checks (in BZF’s absolute determination), the participant’s subscription shall 
be deemed null and void (determined at the sole discretion of BZF) and no rights to BZNT shall be created 
or granted to that prospective participant. In these circumstances, any subscription amount sent to BZF 
will be refunded (net of any administrative fees). 

(c) Participation in the Token Sale will not be available to a person (citizen or resident, tax or otherwise) 
and any company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated, of the following 
jurisdictions: 

 (i) the United States of America; and

 (ii) the People’s Republic of China; 

 (iii)  such other jurisdictions whereby the purchase of BZNT or similar digital token/ cryptocurrency 
may be prohibited or the Token Sale is deemed to be non-compliant with applicable laws and 
regulations. 

(a)  During the public sale period, BZF will release the Token Sale address where participants can send ETH 
to in exchange for BZNT. Participants should send ETH from their MyEtherWallet address rather than 
exchange address to facilitate the transfer of your ERC-20 BZNT. As exchange wallets cannot support 
the holding of new ERC-20 tokens such as the BZNT, any ETH transfers from exchange addresses 
will result in missing BZNT. Any website releasing a Token Sale address before the start of the public 
sale is likely to be a fraud. Please be careful and take extra precaution when transferring ETH to the 
contract address as sending ETH to the wrong address is irreversible. Neither BZF nor Jehmi will be 
responsible for any lost ETH.

https://bezant.io
https://bezant.io


36

(b)  When the public sale is open, BZF will email you the contract address for the fund transfer, subject to 
completion of KYC checks to the satisfaction of BZF. Please contact your respective cryptocurrency 
wallet for details on how to transfer ETH out to another address. 

(c)  Once the ETH transfer is made, BZF will verify the transaction and transfer BZNT to the address from 
which ETH is successfully sent from or provided by the participant at the end of the Token Sale. BZNT 
will be transferrable once the Token Sale has concluded and all checks satisfactorily confirmed. This 
transaction can take up to 24 hours, so please be patient and check your wallet regularly. Should you 
not receive your BZNT within 24 hours, please contact us at info@bezant.io and we will get back to 
you as soon as we can. 

Do take note that only ETH sent from wallet addresses associated with an approved KYC will be accepted 
by the Token Sale contract. Any ETH received from non-approved KYC wallet addresses will be refunded 
and not allocated any BZNT.

ANNEX 1 – LEGALESE AND RISK FACTORS

1. RISK FACTORS
 
The Token Sale, the business and operations of Jehmi and BZF (including but not limited to the Bezant 
Protocol, Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform and Jehmi Business Intelligence Platform, 
and the issue and distribution of BZNT) (collectively, the “Project”) are subject to numerous risks, many of 
which are beyond the control of Jehmi and BZF. Outlined below are certain development risks associated 
with the Project and does not cover all risks associated with the Project.
 
Each Participant should complete independent due diligence into the Project, peruse, comprehend, and 
consider carefully the risks described in this Whitepaper before deciding to support the Token Sale. 
Supporting the Token Sale shall be an action based upon prudent decision and will be deemed as the 
relevant Participant having been fully aware of and agreed to take all the risks described in the Whitepaper.

1.1 TECH

(a)    Development. The Bezant Protocol, Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform, and Jehmi 
Business Intelligence Platform (collectively, the “Project Platforms”) are currently under development 
and may undergo significant changes before release. The Jehmi Payment Platform will feature 
the Jehmi wallet and support in-app purchase support, subscription payment support, exchange 
support, digital item purchase support, and e-commerce payment support. Without completing 
the development of the Bezant Protocol and Jehmi Payment Platform, it will be impossible to 
fully anticipate the challenges associated with ensuring the Jehmi Payment Platform to be able to 
incorporate the components. Depending on the implementation challenges, there may be changes to 
the design, implementation plans, and execution of the Project Platforms. While the Jehmi team will 
use its reasonable efforts to develop and implement the Project Platforms, there is no assurance that 
a completed version of any Project Platform, will be released and/or operational. 

 
(b)   Reliance on internet infrastructure. The Project relies on the performance and reliability of the 

internet infrastructure of the markets in which it operates. There may not be alternative networks or 
data servers in the event of failures or interruptions with the internet infrastructure. Any unscheduled 
service interruption or failure could result in unavailability or limited performance of any Project 
Platform.

(c)   Errors in source code. Despite security audits and peer review, nobody can guarantee that the code 
used by both Jehmi and BZF is error free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects, and bugs, which 
may disable Jehmi and/or BZF in their operations. Such flaws, if any, would compromise the usability, 
stability, and/or security of the BZNT, and the Project, and consequently bring adverse impact on 
BZNT, and the Project.

1.2 TOKEN

(a)   Loss of private key. Private keys are necessary for accessing blockchain assets. Should a private key 
be lost or destroyed, access will be permanently unrecoverable. The loss of a private key either by 
Jehmi or a Participant could result in the loss of BZNT.



38

(b)   Volatile nature of cryptocurrency. The price of cryptocurrencies such as ETH has historically 
experienced large fluctuations. The value of funds raised by the Token Sale may drop significantly 
in case of a sharp drop in ETH price. Since Jehmi will need to use funds in the fiat currency of each 
market the company operates in, a drop in the value of the funds will result in reduced resources for 
Jehmi to operate.

(c)   Termination of Token Sale. The Token Sale could be terminated early due to unforeseen circumstances. 
If funds in ETH have been exchanged to fiat, Participants may be refunded with only part of their ETH 
payments due to the volatility of ETH and/or costs incurred to conduct the Token Sale by BZF.

(d)   Liquidity of BZNT. Trading of the BZNT is not a responsibility or objective of Jehmi or BZF. Secondary 
trading of BZNT will be conducted between voluntary market Participants. There may be a possibility 
that BZNT is not attributed any value or offered for trading by exchanges or marketplaces, which 
would incur difficulty for the token holder to divest their tokens. Due to different regulatory regimes 
in different jurisdictions and the obstacles of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at 
cryptocurrency exchanges, the liquidity of BZNT may be materially different in different countries 
thus resulting in substantial price discrepancies.

1.3 COMPETITION

(a)   Content distribution businesses. There are other businesses looking to develop some form of content 
distribution service. The Jehmi Content Platform seeks to maintain a competitive advantage through 
its incorporation of blockchain technology and decentralisation characteristics, the combination of 
which provides greater transparency, security, privacy and lower transaction costs, and integrity. On 
the back-end, the Jehmi Payment Platform will be integrated so that all prices and transactions are 
visible and verifiable. Potentially one of these competitor businesses could produce, a better, cheaper, 
more accessible, versatile, or customer friendly product, relative to the Jehmi Content Platform. The 
Jehmi Content Platform may make changes to the features and components of the Jehmi Content 
Platform to address market demand and obtain an advantage over comparable products, thus 
increasing its funding requirements.

(b)   Payment services. The adoption of BZNT as the native virtual currency of the Jehmi  Payment Platform 
faces competition from debit and credit card providers and other traditional business in the payment 
service providers. If these businesses could produce a better, cheaper, more accessible, versatile, 
or customer friendly product, the use of BZNT, the Jehmi Payment Platform, and the Jehmi Content 
Platform will face increased competitive forces. 

(c)   Perceived or exposed flaws. It is possible that a comparable product could become popular due 
to a perceived or exposed flaw of any Project Platform that is not addressed by Jehmi effectively 
and expediently. There may also be a perceived advantage of a comparable product that includes 
features not incorporated in any Project Platform. If this product achieves a significant market share, 
the financial condition of Jehmi will be adversely affected and there may be a negative impact on the 
demand for and price of the BZNT.

1.4 SECURITY

(a)   Privacy of Jehmi Private Net. Jehmi has access to a large amount of information through the Jehmi 
Payment Platform, the Jehmi Content Platform, and the Jehmi Marketing Platform. The improper 
use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation. Jehmi may be subject to security 
breaches and attacks, which may compromise the security of the information store in the private 
net Jehmi maintains. Jehmi may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or 
prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Failure to do so would result in a loss in confidence 
of the Jehmi’s business.

(b)   Theft of proceeds. There may be attempts to steal the Token Sale proceeds received by BZF (including 
the fiat currency amount converted therefrom). Such a theft or attempted theft may impact the ability 
of BZF to make the grant to Jehmi to support Jehmi’s expansion and development of the Project 
Platforms. This would have an impact on the corresponding endowment to Jehmi. While BZF will 
adopt best practice technical solutions to keep the Token Sale proceeds safe, certain cyber-thefts 
may not be preventable.

(c)   Other security flaws. With Ethereum and smart contracts being a relatively new area, there are still 
some areas where security issues are being discovered. Consequently, it is uncertain that any audit 
will uncover all security flaws.

1.5    THIRD PARTY

(a)   Reliance on content developers and distribution partners. The Jehmi Payment Platform and Jehmi 
Content Platform primarily relies on third-party content developers to make available their digital 
content such as games, music, and e-books on the Jehmi Content Platform. Jehmi may not be able 
to establish or maintain mutually beneficial commercial relationships with content developers and 
distribution partners. Any failure by Jehmi to effectively localise or market the Jehmi Content Platform 
and Jehmi Payment Platform may adversely impact the utilisation level by content developers and 
distribution partners of the Project Platforms and BZNT.

(b)   Other third party failures. Jehmi’s business involves dependency on other service providers. For 
example, a temporary shutdown of Jehmi’s cloud web server could lead to the Jehmi service being 
put on hold. As the business grows larger, Jehmi will work to reduce the dependency on third party 
services.

1.6 MARKET RISK

(a)   Limited interest. There may be limited interest in the content development and distribution community 
in the use of utility tokens or virtual currency for purchases. As the Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi 
Content Platform and Jehmi Marketing Platform are new products, there is no certainty that the Jehmi 
Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform or Jehmi Marketing Platform and BZNT will be adopted 
or used by a large number of content developers and content distributors. The size and engagement 
level of the Jehmi Content Platform’s user base are critical to the success of Jehmi. Jehmi and BZF 
cannot assure that the user base and engagement levels of the Jehmi Content Platform will grow. 
Such a limited interest could adversely affect the development of the Project Platforms and usage of 
BZNT.



40

(b)   Expansion challenges. As the Jehmi Payment Platform and Jehmi Content Platform expand their 
operations, there exist a risk of the new markets not responding to the Jehmi Payment Platform. 
Jehmi Content Platform, or the use of BZNT due to differences in the economic and infrastructure 
development, political, cultural, legal, and regulatory systems among the countries in which it operates.

(c)   Inability to attain business partners. Jehmi may not be able to find business partners in a new market 
entered, leading to poor business performance.

(d)   A decrease in the growth of digital content. Jehmi and the Project Platforms are dependent on the 
growth of digital content for its success. The business of Jehmi and the user base of the Project 
Platforms may be adversely impacted if the market size of digital content decreases or fails to grow 
at a satisfactory rate.

(e)   No prior market. Prior to the Token Sale, there had been no public market for the BZNT. There is no 
assurance that an active trading market for BZNT will develop, or if it develops, be sustained.

(f)   Price Volatility. The trading market price of BZNT may fluctuate significantly and rapidly as a result of, 
amongst others, perceived risk of BZNT, negative publicity on Jehmi, BZF, the Project Platforms or the 
operating performance of Jehmi. 

1.7 REGULATORY RISK

(a)   New token regulation introduced. Regulatory authorities around the world may introduce new 
regulations to regulate the use of crypto-tokens. BZF may receive queries, notices, warnings, requests 
or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from time to time, or may even be ordered to 
suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the Token Sale or issuance of BZNT. Regulatory 
authorities around the world may also deem BZNT as virtual commodities, digital assets or even 
securities or currencies and therefore could be either prohibited from being traded or held, or be 
permitted to be traded or held, subject to the tax levied, in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local 
regulatory requirements.

(b)   Regulation of Ethereum. Regulation of the Ethereum network may be introduced leading to a 
restriction of access to its networks. An update/migration strategy and implementation will need to 
be developed urgently.

(c)   Regulation of distributed ledger technology. The Bezant Protocol is developed as a private blockchain. 
Regulatory authorities around the world may introduce new regulations to regulate entities carrying 
on a business that uses distributed ledger technology for storing or transmitting value. BZF may 
receive queries, notices, warnings, requests or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from 
time to time, or may even be ordered to suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the 
issuance or transmission of BZNT.

1.8 OTHER  

(a)   Conflict of Interest. There may exist potential circumstances where the interests of Jehmi may diverge 
from those of BZNT holders. Jehmi is not obliged to refrain from such decisions in the interests of 
the company. By supporting the Token Sale, each Participant will be deemed to have acknowledged 
these potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising 
from the existence of any such conflicts of interest.



41

(b)   Unknown unknowns. Jehmi and BZF recognise that there are things that will be discovered in the 
development process which at this point cannot be predicted. In other words, despite best efforts, 
Jehmi and BZF may not yet know all the risks that will be associated with the Project. Part of the 
rationale behind the fundraising is to ensure that Jehmi and BZF have sufficient funds to be able to 
solve such issues as they arise and be able to continue to grow the business.

2. SUPPORTING THE TOKEN SALE

2.1 
Supporting the Token Sale is voluntary. No person will be deemed as committed or obliged to support 
the Token Sale as a result of visiting bezant.io, registering himself/herself with bezant.io, requesting or 
reading any materials (including the Whitepaper) made available by BZF or communicating with BZF in 
any manner.

2.2    
Each person shall only support the Token Sale (a “Participant”) through direct participation with BZF, subject 
to such person’s satisfaction of BZF’s “know-your-customer” and “anti-money-laundering” exercises. The 
following shall not participate in the Token Sale (the following, being “Restricted Participant”):

(a)  a person (citizen or resident, tax or otherwise)
(b)  any company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated,
 
of the following jurisdictions:

(i) the People’s Republic of China;
(ii) the United States of America; and
(iii) such other jurisdictions whereby the purchase of BZNT or similar digital token/ cryptocurrency may 
be prohibited or the Token Sale is deemed to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

2.3    
Each Participant will, upon supporting the Token Sale, be deemed as having perused and comprehended 
the Whitepaper in full (among other things, the risk factors of the Project) and having voluntarily accepted 
all the terms and conditions including but not limited to the disclaimers made and the risks disclosed in 
the Whitepaper.

2.4    
BZF shall be entitled to take any action to identify any Participant at any time, even after the closing of the 
Token Sale. If BZF conducts “know-your-customer” exercises or any other kind of customer due diligence 
to verify the identities of all or part of the Participants, the Participants concerned shall provide all such 
information on a timely basis and shall meet all such requests as may be sought or instructed by BZF for 
that purpose. This shall equally apply to Participants who purchased BZNT via the secondary markets, or 
other secondary purchase mechanisms, as well as primary sales during the Token Sale.

2.5    
If BZF discovers the purchase of BZNT by any Participant violates any anti-money laundering, counter-
terrorism financing or other regulatory requirements, such purchase shall be invalid with retroactive effect 
and BZF shall be entitled to immediately deny the relevant person’s admissibility to the Token Sale, reject 
delivery of any BZNT, irrespective of any payment that could have been made by that Participant.

3. NON-FINANCIAL NATURE OF BZNT

3.1    
A BZNT is not, nor should be construed, understood, deemed or interpreted as:

(a)   an equity interest, voting or non-voting security (or its like) in, or claims against, BZF, Jehmi or any 
other entity in any jurisdiction;

purchased during the Token Sale or otherwise acquired); and each Participant shall be solely liable for 
all such penalties, claims, fines, punishments, liabilities or otherwise arising from his/her non-payment, 
underpayment, undue payment or belated payment of any applicable tax. BZF gives no advice and makes 
no representation as to the tax implications of any Participant’s participation in the Token Sale.

9. NO WAIVER
 
The failure of BZF to require or enforce strict compliance by the Participant with any provision herein or

right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver 
by BZF of any provision, condition, or requirement of the Whitepaper shall not constitute a waiver of any 
future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.

https://bezant.io


49

14.2  
However, the Participant understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early 
development stage and its application is of experimental nature which carries significant operational, 
technological, financial, regulatory, and reputational risks. Accordingly, while the audit conducted raises 
the level of security and accuracy, the Participant understands and accepts that the audit does not amount 
to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract System, the BZNT 
are fit for a particular purpose and/or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities and/or bugs which 
could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH or BZNT.
