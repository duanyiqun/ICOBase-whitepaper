Baller, World Economic Forum Soumitra Dutta, Cornell University Bruno Lanvin, INSEAD

2.Global Fintech Report 2017, PWC

3 Digital assets and the tokenization of commodities

Background
The exponential rise of computational power and storage capacities, along with ever-expanding access 

to knowledge, are some of the key driving forces of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as identified by the 

latest Global Information Technology Report 1 Blockchain technology is, perhaps, the single most exciting 

innovation with enormous implications for revolutionizing products and services, comparable to the 

invention of the Internet 

One of the immediate candidates for disruption by this technological advancement is the Financial Services 

industry, which, up to very recently, has been unhealthily rigid  Financial technology (FinTech) companies 

have challenged the latent incumbents who rely on legacy systems, synonymous with high costs, sluggish 

onboarding processes, and inefficient customer service 2 As FinTechs, now powered by blockchain technological 

capabilities, continue to pave the new road, it comes as no surprise that 88% of all existing players believe 

that they will lose revenue to creative innovators  With $40 billion in capital raised in less than four years, 

FinTech companies have gained substantial traction and а solid base of quality-seeking customers (Global 

FinТech Report, 2017, PWC)  Providing a superior service, ease of use, and lower costs compared to the 

service provided by traditional financial institutions is what ensures that FinTech companies will continue 

to consolidate their market share at an expedited pace 

Apart from the ubiquitous functions of blockchain technology, such as the point-to-value transfers, there 

is one that, up until recently, has been hugely underappreciated – the digitization of assets  The blockchain 

immutably records the transfer of tokens or units of ownership on a distributed ledger and thus makes the 

process trustless and transparent  The digitization of assets (also known as tokenization) is doing the same 

to the securitization of the financial markets as what the advent of the email has done to the post office  

While securitization converts an illiquid asset or group of assets into financial securities, tokenization allows 

for that security to be traded over a digital medium with unprecedented ease and cost efficiency 3  Tokens 

can either have intrinsic value themselves (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other utility tokens) or be the digital 

representation of physical or digital assets (IMF, 2017) 

In the USA, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) keeps centralized digital representation 

custody of more than $37 trillion worth of shares, and it is not improbable that a substantial amount of these 

assets will find their way onto the blockchain via tokenization  Modern investment portfolios consist of 

shares, bonds, commodity futures, and other securities, but unlike in previous decades when most of these 

instruments had a physical form, rarely are assets physically delivered to their owners today  Ownership

rights are handled through central governing authorities such as the DTCC and others  As the popularity of 

decentralized distribution of information and distributed ledger applications pervades the general public, 

people will demand tokenization and decentralized recordkeeping and trading processes  Initiatives to 

tokenize hard assets into the blockchain are already taking place  In March 2017, Natixis, IBM, and Trafigura 

introduced the first blockchain solution for the U S  crude oil market,4 and it is only a matter of time before 

other asset classes are tokenized, tradable, and transferable in a much more efficient manner  Recent 

industry research shows that the market capitalization of many tokenized traditional assets, such as equities, 

debt, commodities, and real-estate will surpass $4 trillion by 2025 5 The tokenization of real-world assets 

is expected to further attract investors by reducing transaction fees, improving transparency with regards 

to ownership rights, and ensuring higher liquidity6 and ease of transferability  

The fact that the overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has grown from $15 billion in January 2017 

to over $527 billion7 in January 2018 makes a strong case for the intrinsic value of this asset class  Although 

interest in cryptocurrencies continues to rise, their proliferation into the real economy is yet to come  One 

of the main reasons for the limited acceptance of the cryptocurrencies as direct means of payment can be 

attributed to the lack of existing technological infrastructure and regulations in most jurisdictions around 

the world (IMF, 2017)  Extracting the value of cryptocurrencies still requires the owners to convert them to

fiat currencies in exchanges or in p2p transactions  The conversion process entails various exchange fees, 

withdrawal fees and capital gain taxes, which ultimately render the entire process slow, time-consuming, 

and cost-ineffective 

By setting this introduction to the major technological trends and challenges that accompany any disruption 

efforts of the financial industry, this white paper aims to describe in detail the procedure of unlocking the 

value of digital assets within the current economic paradigm  Building on the potential of the blockchain, 

Nexo will provide the world’s first instant crypto loans

Nexo Instant Crypto-backed Loans

Problem

Idle Value of Digital Assets

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other emerging cryptocurrencies are rapidly becoming the most widely owned digital 

asset class around the globe  The projected total value of those assets is expected to grow to over $5 trillion 

by 20258  Throughout the past few years, investors; miners; and entrepreneurs have been attracted by the 

spectacular rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, which have created significant wealth for these market 

participants  Although blockchain technologies have yet to find mainstream adoption, as this inevitably 

happens, it will lead to an even higher market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies  However, major 

regulatory and infrastructure limitations remain  These entities deter cryptocurrency owners from actually 

using them in their day-to-day lives and taking advantage of any immediate investment opportunities that 

require liquid cash or meet any short-term obligations (IMF, 2017)  Thus, it is not surprising that an analysis 

performed on cryptocurrency wallets shows that the majority of the transactions are inward with only a 

fraction of the wallets having outgoing transactions at all 

Solution

Unlock the Value of Digital Assets

Instead of simply holding idle digital assets, investors; miners; and entrepreneurs have the opportunity to 

set up an instant crypto loan with Nexo, combining the best of both worlds -- hodl-ing their crypto assets 

and having access to instant cash  By transferring crypto assets to their Nexo wallets, Nexo’s clients are 

able to instantly access cash that is denominated in fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and JPY  The Crypto-

backed Loan is secured by the market value of the digital asset placed in the wallet

Problem

Slow Liquidation Process

Liquidating a digital asset can be burdensome in many ways  Different crypto exchanges trade different 

digital assets and have different requirements, procedures, and withdrawal limitations, which can slow down 

the liquidation process and be costly  Moreover, the clearing bank, which turns the digital asset into a fiat 

currency, has its own procedures and fees that it transfers to the customer, adding costs and slowing down 

the whole process even further  The overall time it might take to complete the transaction could be from 

several days to a month, which is inconvenient in situations where the seller has an urgent need for cash 

Solution

Quick Access to Cash

Nexo’s clients are able to receive cash instantly anywhere around the globe, seize investment opportunities, 

and meet liquidity needs immediately  While withdrawing large amounts of cash is more conveniently done via 

bank transfers, Nexo’s retail clients have the option to use the free credit card for their day-to-day expenses  



9. Worldwide Personal Tax and Immigration Guide 2016–17

Problem

Loss of Ownership

In order to benefit from the intrinsic value of their digital asset, the owners only have the limited option 

of selling them for fiat currencies  This means losing ownership of the asset and forgoing any future price 

appreciation potential it might have  For example, a company that has conducted an ICO would miss 

out on the entire price appreciation of a cryptocurrency that it collected from the crowdfunding but sold 

subsequently to meet capital, R&D, and operating expenditures 

Solution

Retain Ownership

Clients retain 100% ownership of their digital assets  By making use of Nexo’s instant crypto loan rather 

than selling, they keep the entire capital gains and accompanying benefits from their digital assets  Nexo’s 

clients can enjoy their crypto wealth immediately, without having to sell their digital assets 

Problem

Expensive & Tax Inefficient

Depending on the exchange which is used, fees are applied to transactions, including platform fees, usually 

large bid-ask spreads, and withdrawal and transaction fees  Most crucially, selling a digital asset triggers tax 

liabilities  The latest “Worldwide Personal Tax and Immigration Guide”9 published by Ernst & Young shows 

that capital gains taxes range widely from 15% to up to 39% depending on the country and income bracket 

of the person facing the tax liability  Therefore selling it, results in a substantial decrease of the realized 

profit  This renders the entire approach of selling a digital asset to meet a short-term need for liquidity an 

expensive and tax-inefficient solution  Overall, the process of selling leaves the crypto owner in search of 

a better alternative to unlock the value of his or her digital assets

11. Consumers Matter: Loans

Solution

Cost and Tax Efficient

Without having to sell their digital assets on exchanges, the owners do not have to pay any platform, 

transaction, or withdrawal fees that could carve substantial amounts out of their profits  Furthermore, 

since there is no sale event, there are no taxes that could decrease gains by up to 39%, depending on the 

seller’s ordinary residency 

Problem

Cumbersome Credit Checks

The worldwide value of the consumer lending market is estimated to reach $48 3 trillion by 2019,10 and 

it is one of the main economic drivers worldwide, as it provides the general public with additional access 

to finance  Consumer lending is directly linked to the consumer spending, which is the backbone of every 

advanced economy  Most credit institutions perform what are referred to as “hard” credit checks each time 

a person applies for a loan  The goal of those credit checks is to minimize and mitigate the risks of defaults 

and to set an appropriate interest rate in accordance with the risk profile associated with the borrower  

However, the hard credit check procedure is known to leave a mark on the credit score of the applicant  

Recent research11 performed in 2017 by TSB Bank concluded that the damage left from “hard” credit 

checks is substantial and leads to a significant devaluation of the applicant’s credit score  Hard checks lead 

to increased interest rates, depending on the number of applications for unsecured lending instruments  

In conclusion, accessing unsecured financing requires lengthy credit checks and often results in lower 

personal credit scores and higher interest rates on the customer’s loans 



Solution

No Credit Checks

Nexo does not perform any credit checks that could damage the credit rating of its clients, as the crypto 

loan is completely secured by the value of the digital assets stored in the Nexo Wallet 

Problem

Lack of Trust and Transparency

Up to now, transactions aiming to procure loans and financing secured by crypto assets were primarily settled 

through P2P platforms and bilateral agreements  These options usually lack adequate security standards 

and transparency, which is something one would not expect from services associated with blockchain 

technology  A simple search through forums such as Bitcointalk, regarding P2P lending, reveals a world filled 

with fraud, interest rates closer to usury than market conditions, etc  The legal status of such arrangements 

are of a dubious nature and could possibly never be enforced by courts of justice 

Solution

Transparent Blockchain Contracts

Ownership of digital assets is secured and guaranteed by transparent loan contracts, which will ultimately 

be stored on the Blockchain where it is technologically possible 



Business Model
The business model of Nexo is to provide instant crypto loans in order to unlock the value of the digital assets 

owned by its clients  The process is simple and can be broken down into a few simple steps:

Step 1: The Client transfers Crypto Assets to the Nexo Wallet

A prospective client transfers crypto assets to their Nexo Wallet  Once the relevant blockchain confirmations 

for the respective crypto asset are received, the Nexo Oracle automatically calculates the Loan limits and 

instantly sets up the loan 

Step 2: The Client Receives Instant Loan in USD or EURO

The Loan limit is instantly available by bank transfer or the free Nexo Credit Card  Depending on their 

needs and circumstances, the clients can choose the most convenient way to use their cash, as well as the 

currencies in which they would like to receive the funds  The loan limit is based on the market value of the 

crypto assets in the Nexo Wallet  Should the cryptocurrency appreciate in value, the Nexo Oracle increases 

the loan limit 



Step 3: The Client Repays Loan

Clients can repay their flexible loans in multiple ways – via bank transfer, fiat or cryptocurrency  Special 

discounts on the interest rates are granted to those choosing to make payments with NEXO tokens  A 

third option is to pay by partial sale of the crypto assets (BTC, ETH, etc ) in their Nexo Wallet  In addition to 

the flexible repayment options, Nexo does not require any monthly minimum repayments as long as the 

outstanding balance is within the available loan limit  Once a repayment is received, Nexo Oracle records 

the transaction on the blockchain and instantly updates the loan limits 

Step 4: Withdraw Crypto from Nexo Wallet 

If the crypto assets in the wallet meet the required limits of the outstanding loan balance, clients can 

withdraw part or all exceeding amount at any given time  Once the loan is fully repaid, clients can withdraw 

all of the crypto assets in the wallet

13. Crypto Fund List Segmentation

Cryptocurrency Investors
Bitcoin and the rising number of other cryptocurrencies have attracted millions of 

investors throughout 2017  As previously mentioned above, the overall cryptocurrency 

market capitalisation has risen to a staggering $527 billion in January 2018, thus creating 

a sizeable amount of wealth for early investors and entrepreneurs 

There are innumerable reasons why people need liquid cash on hand such as pressing 

unexpected expenses or attractive limited-time offers  Cryptocurrency investors, who 

want to enjoy the fruits of their investments today without having to sell their digital assets, 

can benefit from Nexo’s unique proposition and make use of the free Nexo Credit Card 

to pay for day-to-day expenses or meet other needs  

Hedge Funds
At the present date, there are over 175 hedge funds focusing exclusively on cryptocurrency 

investments13 with about $4 billion in total assets under management 

All funds that already have invested capital under management in crypto assets are also 

direct beneficiaries of Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loans  By placing their digital assets 

in an Nexo Wallet, these hedge funds are able to gain leverage as they gain access to 

additional capital by giving them greater flexibility to structure their portfolios 

Crypto Miners
Cryptocurrency miners are one of the most integral parts of the blockchain 

technology and are directly responsible for the grouping of all unconfirmed transactions 

into blocks and for their recording on the distributed ledger  Therefore, miners are often 

referred to as the backbone of the decentralized world  For performing this activity, 

miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency, which most of them like to hold  The recent

14. All-Time Cumulative ICO Funding – Coindesk ICO Tracker

Crypto Companies
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are steadily becoming an ever more popular way to raise 

capital  Coin Desk’s ICO Tracker reports14 that companies that have conducted ICOs raised 

over $3 7 billion from February 2014 to January 2018  During the typical ICO, companies 

generally accept cryptocurrencies  Once the offerings are completed, companies sell part 

or all of their proceeds for fiat currencies in order to fund their operations or meet their 

capital expenses  Instead of selling their cryptocurrency proceeds and losing substantial 

potential crypto, companies can also use an instant loan from Nexo to finance their needs 

Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study published by the University of Cambridge 

(Hileman and Rauchs, 2017) identified that Bitcoin miners earned billions of dollars in 

the past several years due to the appreciating value of cryptocurrencies; one can see 

why they are not too eager to depart from their crypto holding  Having started just as a 

hobby performed by single PC enthusiasts, mining nowadays requires vast amounts of 

computing power, state-of-the-art equipment, and huge electricity capacities  Meeting 

those increasingly competitive requirements pressures miners, who are looking to 

expand their operations to liquidate their digital asset rewards and potentially miss out 

on future gains from those assets’ appreciation  Nexo offers miners a flexible instant 

crypto loan, which will enable them to fund their increasing capital expenditures and 

operating expenses without having to sell their assets 

Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Exchanges are another essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, matching buyers 

and sellers of the digital assets  Тhe rising number of cryptocurrency exchanges intensifies 

the rivalry among them and the struggle to keep and attract customers  Nexo instant 

crypto loan is specifically designed to provide partnering digital asset exchanges with 

additional leverage and liquidity in order to support their margin lending activities and 

enable them to reach higher capital efficiencies

15. Global ETF assets reach $4tn - Financial Times

Owners of Tokenized Assets
As mentioned earlier, by 2015 the overall market of the tokenized assets is projected to 

exceed 5 trillion  This will allow investors to easily acquire a wide range of asset classes 

that have diverse risk profiles and characteristics, such as:

Precious Metals Investors

Gold has been a safe haven for over two millennia, and it is one of the first hard assets 

to get tokenized   Most notably, the Royal Mint and CME Group have introduced 

RMG - a new, cost-effective, convenient, and secure way to hold, transact, and trade 

physical gold using blockchain technology  Other companies like Digix Global provide 

a user-friendly way for investors to get fast exposure to gold through tokens, which are 

reportedly 100% backed by the precious metal  This presents an excellent opportunity 

for investors to transfer them in their Nexo Wallet and receive an instant loan against 

their tokenized gold holdings 

ETFs and ETNs Investors

In recent years exchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded notes (ETNs) continue 

to gain popularity among investors as they are cheaper passive investment alternatives to 

traditionally active managed funds and deliver comparable if not better returns  The global 

ETF market just recently surpassed $4 trillion and is expected to continue its growth15  

Some of the companies developing solutions to tokenize various assets and securities 

include BrickBlock, LA Token, Blackmoon Crypto, and Bankex  These companies deploy 

proof-of-asset protocols that ensure off-chain asset ownership 

The opportunity to tokenize securities traded on legacy exchanges is immense, and 

Nexo believes that very soon it will be possible for crypto investors to access those 

security-backed tokens and diversify their portfolio  Nexo is partnering up with all major 

security-backed token issuers in order to provide its clients with access to instant loans 

secured by liquid tokenized assets

Loyalty-Reward Token Owners

Loyalty-reward programs are widely used across many domains including retail, hospitality, 

travel, and financial services  According to research conducted by Colloquy, the average 

U S  household participates in 29 loyalty programs16  The overall value of the loyalty 

rewards industry is estimated to be around $60 billion17   Researchers claim that the 

loyalty rewards industry is going to face major disruption by companies that utilize 

blockchain technology18  Those innovative companies will provide the convenient 

redemption of loyalty points on a single platform (Kowalewski, McLaughlin, and Hill, 

2017)  Incent is developing a loyalty reward token that aims to disrupt the industry  As 

part of its roadmap, Nexo plans to accept loyalty reward tokens and allow their owners 

to access instant cash through the crypto loan 

Video Gamers and Virtual Reality Users 

The 2017 Global Games Market Report19 shows that there are currently over 2 2 billion 

gamers around the globe who generate $108 9 billion in revenue  Research suggests 

that by 2020, the gaming industry will reach over $128 5 billion  According to recent 

market research data, the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) industry is 

going to reach $122 billion by 2021  In total, the video game and VR/AR industries will 

have a cumulative value of over $250 billion by 2021  A significant part of the revenues 

generated by the companies operating in the video game and VR/AR industries comes 

from virtual items bought by their users  The leading marketplace for in-game items, 

OPSkins, estimates that there are currently over 400 million gamers who trade virtual 

assets worth more than $50 billion 20

The Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) is the biggest player that has already developed 

blockchain solutions to tokenize in-game items  Nexo will accept WAX tokens in order 

to provide instant crypto loans to gamers who want to retain ownership of their perished 

video-game items

Competitive Landscape
The competitive analysis shows how Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loans compare with alternative 

products and services 

Nexo vs  Traditional Lending

Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loan allows clients to retain 100% ownership of their crypto assets and to 

profit from their potential upside  Furthermore, Nexo’s product is accessible with no credit checks and does 

not have geographic restrictions  The crypto loan is extended instantly as there is no approval procedure  

As soon as the crypto assets are transferred to the Nexo Wallet and the transaction is confirmed on the 

blockchain, the client can start spending the fiat currency of their choice  The interest rates are highly 

competitive and there are no additional or hidden fees 



Nexo vs  Other Lending Platforms

A number of companies promise lending solutions to the crypto community, and currently all of them are 

operating as P2P platforms for collateralized and uncollateralized loans  The decentralization of lending 

brings significant costs and slows down the whole process, ultimately resulting in a deteriorating user 

experience  Lenders who are willing to participate in those platforms carry the significant burden of managing, 

monitoring, and supervising loan offers, which makes it inconvenient and inefficient  Matching borrowers 

with lenders who are willing to fund the loan requests takes a lot of time, as terms must be agreed upon by 

all of the parties involved  These characteristics of P2P lending render the whole process cumbersome and 

slow  Recent data shows clearly that the demand for loans is much greater than the supply, resulting in an 

inefficient market  Nexo is there to bridge precisely this gap, ensuring enough supply of funds to provide 



instant loans, thus providing adequate liquidity for the crypto community in an efficient manner  The Nexo 

team has 10+ years of experience in instant lending solutions and has granted more than $120 М in loans 

to millions of customers throughout Europe 

Furthermore, getting funding from Nexo is a seamless, instant process  Whereas other providers charge 

membership, application, and/or funding fees on top of their interest rates, Nexo has no fees whatsoever and a 

very competitive annual interest rate  Furthermore, NEXO token holders enjoy discounted repayment 

rates while loan limits can be increased using NEXO tokens, just as they can with Bitcoin or Ethereum  

Nexo’s business model is designed with the sole mission of aligning clients’ interests with those of the 

company 

21. The information for comparison between Nexo’s flexible loan and alternatives on the market, 

including details on financial and non-financial parameters, has been extracted from publicly available 

information and all calculations represent our best estimate of cost for exploiting such services

Nexo vs  Alternative Financing Options21



22. Net Worth is defined as the total change in net value, including fees paid, taxes 

due and net gains/losses from change in BTC price in 60 days. The client is rational 

and seeks to explore options with different risk appetite and volatility.

Assumptions:
Let us assume that the client has in his possession Bitcoins and requires fiat money in order to fulfill a financial 

need, whatever that might be  In particular, let’s assume that he has the following portfolio:

Ownership of 5 BTC purchased at $2,100

Needed financing = $14,000

Current price of BTC = $4,000 (Net Worth = $20,000)

Days fiat is needed = 60 days

The client seeks short-term financing equal to $14,000 for 60 days and desires to retain ownership of Bitcoin 

(BTC) after the completion of the transaction (5 BTC) while minimizing costs 22

Financing options:

1   Nexo Instant Crypto-backed Loan

The client sets up an instant crypto loan for $14,000 without any credit checks  He transfers 5 

BTC to his Nexo Wallet and gets cash instantly via bank wire or credit card  With this strategy, the 

client pays only interest with no trade or deposit fees and does not become liable to capital gains 

tax because no sale of assets occurs 

2  Sell & Buy Option

The client sells 70% of his holdings today for $14,000 and repurchases the same amount of Bitcoins 

in 60 days at the future price  Once a position is liquidated, the client pays trade, exchange and 

withdrawal fees, and he is liable for capital gains tax  When he has to re-establish his position by 

repurchasing the coins in 60 days, the client once again faces trade, exchange and deposit fees  

Obviously, a lot can happen in two months, and the sale price might substantially differ from 

the new purchase price; thus, the client is exposed to the volatility of the market on top of the 

additional cost, which he pays 

3  Sell & Margin Lending Option

The client sells 70% of Bitcoins today for $14,000 with all applicable fees and taxes  The remaining 

30% of Bitcoins are used to open a 3 33x margin trading position in order to mimic the ownership 



of 5 BTC  The client becomes liable for additional exchange fees, opening/closing margin trading 

position fees, and rollover interest for maintaining an open margin trading position for 60 days  In 

two months, the client closes the margin and repurchases the BTC at the future price, becoming 

exposed to market volatility and counterparty risk  By applying this strategy, the client is able to 

retain the upside potential from a Bitcoin price increase but at a high cost 

4  Futures & Swaps

The client sells 70% of Bitcoins today for $14,000 with all applicable fees/taxes  The remaining 

30% of Bitcoins are used to open a short/long swap or future position  In order to mimic ownership 

of 5 BTC, a 3 33x margin is utilized  By using swaps, the client pays additional exchange fees and 

interest expenses for maintaining an open swap/future position for 60 days  This trading strategy 

is highly speculative and risky – it requires specific knowledge of financial instruments and trading 

techniques 

Summary of Net Worth under BTC price change

In case of a constant bitcoin price, the Nexo instant crypto loan delivers a 7-times cheaper solution when 

compared to the sell & buy option as described above  The cost has been calculated based on the price 

structures of several of the major cryptocurrency exchanges  The sell & buy back option includes fees like 

platform usage, bid-ask spread, withdrawal, transaction (miners) fees, and capital gains on crypto asset 

sales while Nexo includes only interest  Moreover, when the price of bitcoin increases, while the client uses 

his Nexo instant crypto loan, he benefits as he ultimately owns it (a 20% increase in bitcoin price leads to an 

additional $4,000 gain for the client) 

The sell & margin lending approach is 7 8 times more expensive than an Instant crypto loan form Nexo  

And with margin selling, the client also retains the price appreciation opportunities but exposes himself 

to the following:



 · Market Volatility – margin trading involves substantial risks of total loss and requires special technical 

knowledge if it is to be executed properly 

 · Margin Calls – on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, for example, an investor would receive a margin 

call at 80% of the funds pledged in his margin account, and his position will be liquidated at 40%  In 

the current example, if the client pledges $6,000 of own funds to open a 3 33x margin position at 

$20,000, he would receive a margin call as soon as the price of Bitcoin decreased by 6%, and he would 

be liquidated when the price of Bitcoin dropped by 18%  Percentage changes in cryptocurrency trading 

occur on a regular basis; thus, the risk of early liquidation and undesired fees and costs is not negligible 

Trading swaps and futures is more than 10 times more expensive than taking advantage of an instant crypto 

loan from Nexo  In addition, derivatives trading are a complex endeavour that requires experience and 

serious funding and might result in losses that exceed the initial deposit  Furthermore, derivatives trading 

require access to platforms that require highly technical trading knowledge, which makes the process too 

complex for retail investors  In a swap/forward scenario within the current example, the liquidation would 

begin as soon as the price of Bitcoin decreased by 15% 

The cost efficiency of the Nexo instant crypto loans, the flexibility of available funds whenever the customer 

needs them, and the retained ownership of the digital asset all make Nexo a much better choice to instantly 

unlock the value of digital assets 



Technology
Cutting-edge technology and process automation are at the core of Nexo’s business model  Powered by 

Credissimo’s 10+ years of experience in online lending, Nexo is in an excellent position to develop a top-notch 

solution that extends crypto loans secured by crypto assets  Since its inception, Credissimo has strived to 

achieve optimal operational efficiencies through proprietary process automation and constant innovation  

Moreover, Credissimo has developed and implemented a software system that supports the full automation 

of its business processes  This system integrates all stages of the lending process through functionalities 

covering the period from a loan’s application and disbursement to its servicing, full repayment, accounting, 

and reporting  Unlike for many startup business ventures, the transfer of core competencies from Credissimo 

to Nexo uses a robust technological platform as a springboard and benefits from the rich experience of 

seasoned professionals  While Credissimo has provided instant online consumer loans to millions of people 

for over 10 years, Nexo builds on extensive existing knowledge to offer the world’s first instant crypto loans 

Nexo Oracle
The critical, essential part of our technological model is Nexo Oracle – an automated system that maintains 

the elements of the business processes and has the functionalities as identified in the diagram below:



Development of loan contracts: 

When a crypto loan is set up, the Nexo Oracle is responsible for the automatic disbursement of cash, asset 

maintenance, notifications, and overall management 

Development of real-time data aggregation: 

The Nexo Oracle performs real-time asset valuation based on data from multiple exchanges at any given 

point in time  The Nexo Oracle maintains live data aggregation from at least 6 independent sources 

(exchanges), which minimizes overall risk for both Nexo and the client  The Nexo Oracle also detects live 

changes in asset value and recalculates loan limits  In the case of asset price appreciation, the loan limit is 

automatically and instantly increased 

Development of repayment analytics module:  

The Nexo Oracle automatically records repayments and further accounts for all transactions made by 

clients  Interest repayments, outstanding balances, and up-to-date loan limits are automatically maintained 

at all times by the system 

Development of automated notifications: 

All loan maintenance actions are automatically executed by the Nexo Oracle without any manual intervention 

– change in asset value and loan limit; cash inflows/outflows; maintenance and rebalancing warnings are 

issued in case of reached minimum crypto asset limits; individual account balances are updated with 

repayments; administrative notifications are sent to the client with all relevant information 

Development of modeling and algorithms: 

In order to secure the proper functioning of the system, Nexo integrates big data analyses, self-regulating 

algorithms, and prediction modelling in the Nexo Oracle  That way, Nexo can guarantee that the information 

received from multiple external data sources is used for proper on-time business decision-making 



Loan Contracts

Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are pre-written computer protocols that aim to facilitate a trustless and secure relationship 

between two parties  Their key features include immutability and traceability, which create transparency 

and remove the need for third-party involvement24  Although not all blockchains currently support smart 

contracts, Nexo’s long-term goal is to enable a fully automated trustless system across all blockchain assets 

supported by the Nexo Wallet  This can be achieved through strategic partnerships with companies that 

are currently developing cross-chain solutions such as Polkadot 

The smart contract used by Nexo will record the current outstanding balances of the client’s Nexo Wallet  

Interest will be accrued on the utilized loan balances  Once clients repay their loans or use more of their 

available limits, Nexo will either credit or debit the balance and record the updated one on the blockchain 

Once they are fully functioning across different blockchains, the smart contracts will be the primary 

mechanism that regulates most functions of the Nexo Instant Crypto-backed Loans  Until the complete 

and stable development of cross-chain technologies allow the deployment of smart contracts, most of 

those functionalities will be delivered through the Nexo Oracle 



Risk Management
In order to minimize any risks, the Nexo Oracle tracks the changes of the crypto assets’ value placed in the 

Nexo Wallet in real time  To avoid any price discrepancies, the Nexo Oracle will draw real-time data from 

several different sources  The crypto assets within the client’s Nexo Wallet should have value to cover the 

outstanding loan at all times  If the price of the crypto assets placed in the wallet increase, the Nexo Oracle 

will immediately increase the amount of cash available to the client 

Should the value of the crypto assets decrease below a liquidation ratio (dependant on the assets within the 

wallet), the Nexo Oracle acts accordingly and mitigates the risk of reaching the minimum loan requirements 

by a smooth repayment of the loan  There are various scenarios, which could occur throughout the loan 

usage that require Nexo Oracle’s interference  For the purpose of illustration, examples of Nexo’s expected 

situation handling actions are shown below 

Once the client has set up their account with Nexo, they agree to the terms and conditions, and they will transfer 

crypto assets to their Nexo Wallet  The Nexo Oracle automatically updates the funds, which are instantly 

available to the client through his Nexo credit card 

A few days later, the Nexo Oracle detects that the value of the crypto assets placed in the Nexo Wallet by 

the client have decreased below the minimum required limits, which leads to an immediate recalculation of 

the available loan limit  The Nexo Oracle issues instant notifications to the client through multiple channels, 

including the client’s Nexo Wallet and via SMS and e-mail  In case the client has a larger outstanding balance 

than the available limit, the Nexo Oracle provides the client with the following options:





Option I: Add More Crypto Assets to the  

Nexo Wallet 
Clients can transfer additional crypto assets to their wallet in order to rebalance the loan limits  In this specific 

case, the Nexo Oracle automatically calculates the additional crypto assets that the clients would have to 

add to their wallet, and once the transfer is confirmed, his loan limits are instantly updated  Whenever clients 

repay the loan or have any excess crypto placed in their wallet, they can securely withdraw it 

Option II: Partial Repayment
Clients also have the option to repay the difference between the loan limit and current loan outstanding 

amount  In this case, the Nexo Oracle calculates the amount needed to be covered and the client pays it 

by wire or by transferring crypto  Although the Nexo Oracle will take all necessary actions to inform the 

client in a timely manner regarding any changes in the value of his crypto assets, it should be considered 

that it might not act upon the issued notifications   In this case, the Nexo Oracle will automatically cover 

the difference between the loan limit and current loan outstanding amount by proceeding to a rebalancing 

maintenance 

Rebalancing Maintenance
In cases where the client does not act on the notifications issued by the Nexo Oracle and does not opt to 

transfer additional crypto assets or repay the required amount, the Nexo Oracle executes a rebalancing 

maintenance  The price of the pledged crypto assets is verified at multiple exchanges so that the best 

possible terms are secured  In this specific case, the Nexo Oracle uses the best possible price on the market 

and sells crypto assets to rebalance loan limits  All relevant taxes related to the transaction will be covered 

through the client’s loan 



Customer Acquisition
Nexo is able to draw from Credissimo’s longstanding marketing and customer acquisition experience, which 

will provide a solid base for future development 

The new paradigm of global interconnectedness requires new marketing strategies, which will attract 

and retain loyal customers from around the world  Nurturing a strong community and mutually beneficial 

strategic partnerships are two of the main objectives that will support Nexo’s growth and success 

Airdrop Campaigns
In order to expand and nurture the Nexo community, we will execute multiple Airdrop campaigns  The 

participants in the Nexo Airdrop campaigns will be able to receive free NEXO tokens that will allow them 

to benefit from lower interest rates and/or higher limits on their instant crypto loans  To participate in 

Nexo Airdrop campaigns, people will be required to fulfil predefined conditions that will be described and 

distributed via multiple communication channels  Upon successful campaign completion and meeting the 

predefined requirements, the participants will receive their free Nexo tokens in their Nexo Wallet, which 

they can use immediately towards their instant crypto loans - thus being exposed to Nexo’s product at 

minimal marketing cost-per-acquisition 

Referral & Affiliate Programs
Nexo’s clients and supporters can participate in special referral programs that reward their efforts to attract 

new clients and expand the Nexo community  The program ensures that supporters who refer new clients 

to Nexo will receive preferential interest rates on their instant crypto loans 

Strategic Partnerships
Operating in the constantly evolving cryptocurrency/blockchain ecosystem requires engagement in 

strategic partnerships that support the overall development of the community and Nexo’s business model  

For example, we can use wallet integrations by implementing a button that allows users of widely used wallet 

apps to set up a crypto loan instantly with Nexo  This is currently being discussed with several wallet providers
