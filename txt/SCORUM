Introduction 
In their report, Nielsen notes that the sports media landscape is as fragmented 
as ever, with content being consumed from a wide variety of devices. While 
passionate fans are eager to engage with sports media from all angles, 
established media corporations are struggling to present their content in line with 
the rapid pace of technological advancement. In this respect, blockchain 
technology can take the sports media industry to a new level. We are excited to 
introduce an innovative sports media platform with its own internal economy 
based on free market principles – Scorum. 

Scorum is a blockchain powered sports media that rewards its active users. 
Authors get rewarded for adding their publications, comments and photos while 
readers gain by casting their votes for quality content.  

Scorum’s economic model is based on principles that strive to ensure its 
cryptocurrency is supported with the real economy and the benefits are allocated 
fairly among all the system’s participants.  

The project team has already developed a working prototype of Scorum's 
statistical center, and our partners and industry experts made it possible for us to 
formulate an optimal product roadmap for the Scorum platform. 

To finance further development of the platform and distribute tokens to future 
users, Scorum offers Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency during the Token 
Crowdsale.

Fundamental Principles  
Our Mission 
Our mission is to jump-start the sports media evolution and enable Scorum 
community members to be fairly rewarded for sharing their passion for sports. 
This concept stands in stark contrast with the way traditional media businesses 
operate. 

Scorum is the first blockchain-powered sports media platform. We aim to firmly 
establish ourselves in this niche and ensure stable development of our platform. 
We estimate the potential global audience size for the Scorum platform to be 1 
billion users aged 18 to 40. 

To maximize audience engagement, maintain high content quality and establish 
an active sports enthusiast community, Scorum offers the following benefits: 

1. A fair internal economic model based on blockchain technology.  

2. Built-in instruments for authors (interactive visualization tools, photo 
database, advanced sports analytics). 

3. Fully featured statistical centers for various sports. 

4. Commission-free betting exchange. 

5. In-house sports experts who ensure high quality of the sports analytics 
data. 

Given the platform’s unique value proposition, Scorum believes it has what it 
takes to become a cutting-edge media source at the heart of which lies passion 
for sports.

Functionality Overview 
Functionality-wise, Scorum is a new-generation sports media source that 
features: 

● sports content optimised blogging platform 

● statistics center with integrated services and live streams   

● commission-free fantasy sports platform  

● commission-free betting exchange 

We’ve already developed the beta version of Scorum’s statistics center; upon 
which we will base the functionality of other services within the platform, 
including the betting exchange and data visualization tools for bloggers. 

The fantasy sports platform prototype is almost ready. Its users will finally be 
able to play for tokens.   

At the moment, we are also developing special analytics tools for authors using 
the BI-based services already integrated into the statistics center. 

Thanks to our decision to start product development with Scorum’s statistics 
center, we have already received positive feedback about our platform from both 
sports enthusiasts and professionals. 

In other words, our team at Scorum is well on its way to transforming these beta 
features into a fully functional platform. As we develop Scorum, we will continue 
focusing on the needs of the sports community as a whole as well as its specific 
segments.

Reward System  
By using Blockchain technology as the platform’s foundation, we were able to 
create a transparent and reliable reward system for Scorum authors and active 
platform members. 

To implement this functionality, we issue Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency 
and Scorum Power (SP) tokens. 

Built-in Instruments for Authors 
The Scorum blogging platform makes it easy for content creators to design 
engaging and visually appealing content, which in turn allows authors to focus 
their effort on writing quality publications about sports. 

Aside from the simple yet feature-rich editing tools, we have developed custom 
solutions for sports writers: 

1. Widgets displaying statistics center data which can be incorporated into 
publications with just a few clicks. 

2. Built-in photo database where authors can get quality images for their 
publications.  

3. Sports analytics tools which allow content creators to quickly create 
interactive data visuals. 

We are developing Scorum’s features with the focus on sports media audience 
interests which allows us to preserve the platform’s ease of use while 
maintaining its high level of functionality.

Statistics Center  
The statistics center provides users with information about various kinds of 
sports as well as match results, statistical data, player and team profiles, and live 
match broadcasts. Users will also be able to purchase sporting goods and 
services like event tickets from our partners. 

For authors the statistics center offers a new generation of sports analytics 
tools that enable content writers to create interactive visuals with the help of the 
center’s built-in BI services. Services such as forecasting system, sports texts 
analysis, sports chat bots and more will also be available within the statistics 
center. 

Within Scorum’s partner programs we have already integrated Microsoft’s Power 
BI and are planning to add similar services from Google and IBM in the future.

Fantasy Sports Integration 
The Scorum platform is excited to offer commission-free fantasy sports league 
integration within the project.  

As FSAT estimates that, in the US and Canada this year one in five people actively 
took part in fantasy sports for a total of almost 60 million participants. This is up 
from 32 million in 2010 with participation data showing consistent growth year 
over year since 2003.  

Of these players, over one-third were teenagers and the average age of fantasy 
sports participants is 38 years old. Players over the age of 18 spend an average 
of $556 dollars per year to participate in fantasy sports.  

All of this interest in fantasy sports competition drives further engagement with 
sports media with nearly two-thirds of fantasy players saying that they watch 
more live sports and read more sports coverage as a result of their participation 
in fantasy leagues.

Commission-free Betting Exchange 
Scorum's commission-free sports betting exchange is fully capable of potentially 
replacing traditional betting platforms. Within Scorum, users can quickly and 
easily bet against each other without having to pay any commission or extra 
fees. 

It’s worth noting that the betting exchange is not a source of income for the 
Scorum platform and acts solely as a marketing tool. Furthermore, Scorum 
provides the betting exchange for entertainment value only as a game of skill for 
it users. The betting exchange shall not be accessible in jurisdictions where it 
may be prohibited or require further licensing under such jurisdiction’s online 
gambling laws. Based on data cited by the BBC, the potential market volume for 
the cryptocurrency sports betting market exceeds 1 trillion USD. 

Due to the uncertain state of regulation on a global scale in the field of virtual 
token betting, we cannot guarantee the legality of Scorum betting exchange 
platform or ability to structure and license our future betting exchange platform 
in any given jurisdiction. However, we strive to be a responsive and compliant 
company should we face any regulatory inquiry.

Basics of Scorum Economic 
Model 
Scorum’s economic model is based on the following principles: 

1. Cryptocurrency needs to be supported by the real economy. 

2. All the active participants must benefit. 

3. Income distribution should be objective and fair and controlled by the user 
community. 

At the moment, there are three planned stable revenue sources:

1. Internal pay-per-click advertising. Content authors will be able to use it to 
promote the content they create. 

2. Partner programs. Within the platform, users will be able to buy various 
sports products from our partners: 

● Live broadcasts of sporting events. 

● Event tickets. 

● Sports merchandise. 

● Other sporting goods.  
 
These sporting goods and services will be sold at a discount when 
purchased with Scorum Coins instead of other currencies.

�  19



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

3. Photo database. Authors will be able to use photos for their publications 
from the large built-in photo database. 10% of the photo’s value goes to 
Scorum.  

To learn more about income distribution at Scorum, please read the “SCR 
Distribution from Scorum Revenue” section.

The mathematical payout allocation and distribution model is available on 
Google Sheets. 

Scorum Tokens 
To ensure proper functioning of the Scorum economy, we are issuing the Scorum 
Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency and the Scorum Power (SP) internal token.  

Scorum Coin (SCR) is planned  to operate on the Scorum platform. It can also be 
transferred to other users. These are the tokens that will be available for 
purchase during the Token Crowdsale. 

Scorum Power (SP) is an internal token that needed to enable technical 
interactions between the system’s users. SP value is directly proportional at 1:1 
ratio to SCR. 

Using Scorum Coins 

SCR may be used within the Scorum platform in the following ways:

1. SCR owners can purchase partner products and services using SCR (see the 
“Basics of Scorum Economic Model” section). 

2. SCR can be used to pay for in-platform ads (see the “Basics of Scorum 
Economic Model” section).

�  

3. SCR can be used at the integrated commission-free sport betting exchange. 
 
According to data cited by the BBC, the size of the fiat sports betting market 
reached the 1 trillion USD mark 4 years ago. It is difficult to obtain more 
accurate data because of the large number of market players and its non-
transparent economy. However large its size today, it is plausible to assume 
that all the fiat money of the sports betting industry will migrate into 
commission-free solutions which can only be implemented using blockchain 
technology. Scorum is aiming to dominate this market niche. 

4. SCR can be purchased on the Scorum website. To ensure that buying SCR is 
quick and easy, our platform will function as an intermediary between users 
and cryptocurrency exchanges. The option to buy SCR on the Scorum 
website will provide an additional revenue stream for Scorum and will have a 
positive effect on SCR usability. 

Using Scorum Power 

SP tokens can only be used inside the Scorum platform. They are needed to 
ensure technical interactions between system users and to allocate rewards to 
users including the Bounty Program rewards. 

Owning SP has the following advantages:

● The more SP, the higher the probability to get the delegate status and have 
an impact on Scorum’s project development. 

● The more SP, the more influence the user’s opinion has within the project 
(Voting Power). 

● The more SP, the larger the share in the reward pool for owning SP.

Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

Users can get Scorum Power for registering on the platform as well as creating 
content, voting and signing blocks.  

For more information about ways to get SP, please see the “SP Emission and 
Distribution” section. 

In order to prevent SP’s entering the exchanges and to protect the system’s 
integrity, it will not be possible to transfer SP between users. 

Therefore, only SCR tokens will be available at the exchanges (see “SCR > SP > 
SCR Conversion” section) 

SCR > SP > SCR Conversion 

At the Scorum platform, the SCR-to-SP exchange happens immediately.

It is also possible to exchange SP into SCR in equal shares within 12 months 
after conversion process activation (this time frame can later be changed by the 
delegates). This measure is aimed at protecting token holders’ interests. 

SP > SCR conversion will be available only after adding the internal advertising 
into the platform. This measure is aimed at supporting the SCR exchange rate by 
increasing the demand for the tokens from the side of advertisers. 

SCR Emission and Distribution 
To finance further development of the platform, Scorum is issuing Scorum Coins 
(SCR) cryptocurrency and putting it up for sale to token purchasers during the 
Token Crowdsale. A finite amount of SCR and SP tokens will be issued. 

Scorum Coins cryptocurrency totalling 20M is created and sold as part of the 
Token Crowdsale: 

�  22



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

● 18.6M SCR are put on sale and used for creation and development of the 
Scorum project. 

● 930K SCR are distributed as part of Token Crowdsale Affiliate Program. 

● 470K SCR are distributed on a long-term basis among Scorum team as 
incentive bonuses. 

Afterwards, SCR can be produced only by means of SP > SCR conversion. All the 
SCR tokens unsold during Token Crowdsale will be converted into SP. Throughout 
the year, all the received tokens will be converted into SCR, sold at the exchange 
and used for Scorum product development.  

Token Crowdsale Summary 

Token distribution  

20M SCR are distributed during the Token Crowdsale in the following stages: 

1. 1 600 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.5 USD (fiat currency equivalents here 
and throughout are provided for informational purposes only; no fiat 
currency will be accepted in the Token Crowdsale). Total for 800K USD — 
50% discount from nominal value. 

2. 2 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.75 USD. Total for 1.5M USD — 25% 
discount from nominal value. 

3. 3 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.9 USD. Total for 2.7M USD — 10% 
discount from nominal value. 

4. 12 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 1 USD. Total for 12M USD — nominal 
value.

Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

Funds allocation  

1. 65% of the raised funds go towards the development. Most of the functions 
of Scorum will be implemented within the first year, but they will require 
continued refinement and development as the platform grows in popularity 
and expands to cover all major sports. Much of the initial development 
funds will be spent on establishing contracts with statistics providers so 
that our statistics center have the latest in-depth sports data for Scorum 
users to access.  
 
Integrating and expanding Scorum as a competitor in the US sports media 
industry will require significant funds to tailor the design of the platform to 
fit the needs and interests of each unique fan community.  

2. 20% will be dedicated to marketing. As a direct way to get connected to the 
widest audience of sports fans, Scorum will use professional athlete 
promotion of the project through its ambassador program.  

Scorum’s blogging platform will provide a direct connection from athletes to 
their supporters and the partner programs will give the fans exclusive deals 
to buy merchandise endorsed by their favorite athletes.  

Scorum ambassadors will make use of a variety of promotional strategies to 
incentivize fan participation in Scorum including: 

● Autographed jersey and merchandise giveaways  

● Event ticket lotteries with a chance to meet and chat with Scorum 
ambassadors 

● Live online chats with athletes through Scorum’s platform 

● Personal blog posts and updates on Scorum  

�  24



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

● Active users and fans will get to meet and greet ambassadors at 
Scorum Fest and other regional meet-ups. 

3. 15% is set aside for legal support, as the international and local regulations 
around cryptocurrency based projects are in an ever state of change. 

For local and European regulatory advice, we rely on Revera, a top business 
law firm with 18 years of experience working with over 3000 international 
clients. 

We also cooperated with Velton-Zegelman PC, based in San Francisco. Their 
firm has years of experience guiding tech start-ups to navigate the 
international regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Julian Zegelman, 
partner of the company, has also entered our advisory board. 

According to the Velton-Zegelman PC resolution, Scorum’s liquid 
cryptocurrency has met the requirements of a utility token according to the 
Howey test. 

Scorum Team Incentive Program 

470K SCR are emitted in order to motivate the employees of the company. These 
tokens will be paid as bonuses in addition to salaries until the allocated sum is 
fully paid out. 

Token Crowdsale Affiliate Program  

930K SCR are available for affiliates who help attract token purchasers for the 
Token Crowdsale. 

Every affiliate that participates in the program has its unique referral code (the 
link with the code is available in users’ personal account on the Scorum Token 
Crowdsale website) which can be used to track Scorum Coins buyers. The

affiliate will receive 5% SCR based on the amount of SCR their referral links 
generate. 

For example, an affiliate placed the link on social networks. A certain number of 
token purchasers went via this link to buy 1000 SCR. Thus the affiliate will get 50 
SCR.  

Tokens not distributed via this program will be destroyed. 

SP Emission and Distribution: 10M Bounty 
Program 
Scorum Power Tokens will be emitted in the course of user registration. A 
maximum of 10M SP will be issued. The nominal value of 1 SP = 1 SCR = 1 USD. 
Scorum Power tokens will be distributed as part of the Bounty program. 

Scorum Power Distribution:   

● 2.1M SP— registration bonuses 

● 3.84M SP — bonuses for voting and commenting 

● 3M SP — to founders 

● 0.1M SP — to Steemit users 

● 0.48M SP — to witnesses (users signing blocks) 

● 0.48M SP — to active SP holders 

As all the rewards from the bounty program are paid in SP tokens, the 
conversion of which into SCR will be delayed, new SCR are expected to appear on

the market in small quantities and will be directly dependent on project’s 
popularity.  

The system is secured against falsified registrations and other attacks thanks to 
the following mechanisms:

1. Gradual SP burning in case of user inactivity. 

2. Delayed SP > SCR conversion. 

Registration Reward Pool 

Amount: 2.1M SP 

SP rewards for registration will be allocated in 4 stages. At each stage, the

Activity Reward Pool 

Amount: 3.84M SP 

The activity reward pool gets replenished with each registration on the Scorum 
website. Each new registration results in the pool getting replenished in equal 
sums within 100 days.  

For example, during the first stage when new users get registered, the process of 
pool replenishment begins at 0.0914 SP per user per day for 100 days, which is 
equal to 9.14 SP in total. Going forward, the pools collected in this manner are 
distributed among users that were active on the website (submitted publications, 
commented, voted, etc.).

SCR Activity Reward Pool  
Scorum rewards its active users for creating and engaging with platform content. 
40% of Scorum’s advertising revenue go to SCR activity reward pool. This amount 
is distributed among authors of publications and readers who evaluate content 
by voting for it. Each user can cast their vote for publications and comments on 
Scorum’s blogging platform as well as vote for comments within the statistical 
center.  

Voting Power (VP) 
Each user has a dynamic parameter Voting Power (VP) which gets spent during 
voting and gets fully recovered within 120 hours (5 days). The maximum VP 
value is equal to the user’s current amount of SP. 

With each vote, up to 5% of the remaining Voting Power is spent. The more often 
the user votes, the less power each vote has as VP does not have enough time to 
recover. 

The more VP a post or a comment gets, the higher the payout, which is 
distributed between the post’s author, commentary creator, photographer as well 
as the users who voted for it. 

Reward distribution depends on the following factors: 

1. VP of the voter that is given for the post. The more VP given for a post, the 
higher the payout. 

2. Sequence. Users that voted earlier get paid at a higher payout rate. 

3. Time from the moment of publication. 

● The later the voting happens, the smaller the payout.

● In order to protect the system from spam voting, we implement the 
following system: during the first 30 minutes after publishing a post or 
a comment, a portion of the voters’ rewards goes to the content 
creator. If a vote or comment comes within the first minute of content 
publication, 100% of rewards will go to the author. This percentage will 
gradually go down to 0% by the 30th minute. 
 
For example, if a vote comes in on the 15th minute after publishing, 50% 
of the rewards will go to the post’s author. If users consider the post 
trendy and valuable, they should share a portion of their earnings and 
cast their vote earlier in order to keep their VP high. 

Publication Statuses 
Scorum publications are categorized into three statuses:

1. New. No one has voted for a publication and no more than 12 hours have 
passed from the moment of its creation. Publication does not get any 
rewards. 

2. Active. From the moment the first vote has been cast, the post will remain 
active for 7 days and receives payouts from the SP and SCR activity reward 
pools. 

3. Archive. If a publication has not received any votes for 12 hours, OR if 7 
days have passed since the moment of its activation, the publication moves 
into an inactive state and does not participate in the reward distribution. 

Each user gives a part of their Voting Power at the moment of voting. During its 
active state, a post accrues Voting Power and participates in the reward 
allocation process from the SCR activity reward pool. The tokens from pools are 
distributed once per minute. The more Voting Power a post gets, the bigger its

reward share which gets distributed from the SCR activity reward pool. Only 
active posts participate in the reward distribution process. 

Activity Reward Distribution 
At Scorum, users get rewarded for being active on the platform: from post 
authors to commenters to users who cast their votes for posts. 

The special feature in the comment reward system at Scorum is that 50% of 
commenting rewards for posts goes to the original post or comment. This way 
authors of interesting content get extra rewards if their post spurs lively 
discussions. This commenting reward hierarchy is preserved up to the 6th level.

Scorum has developed an analogous reward system for comments left for 
entities within the statistics center (players, judges, coaches, clubs, leagues 
etc.). Comment authors get rewarded as well as all the verified entities within the 
statistics center. It’s important to note that Scorum will administer payouts only 
to verified entities in the statistics center. If an entity is not verified, the tokens are 
kept on their accounts until the verification process is complete. Such system 
allows Scorum to involve sports industry professionals in the project.

Publication author gets:

● 75% from the publication payout sum.

● 50% from the payout sum allocated for all authors of comments of the 1st 
level. 

● 25% from the payout sum allocated for all authors of comments of the 2nd 
level.

● And so forth until the comments of the 6th level inclusive.

● 50% from the payout sum for all the comments of the 1st level. 

● 25% from the payout sum for all the comments of the 2nd level.

● And so forth until the comments of the 6th level inclusive.

Statistical center entity gets:

● 50% from the payout sum for all the comments of the 1st level.

● 25% from the payout sum for all the comments of the 2nd level. 

● And so forth until the comments of the 6th level inclusive.

User who voted gets: 

● 25% of the payout for the publication/comment distributed among all the 
users who voted for it. 

Photographers Reward Pool 
The photographer reward pool is continuously replenished with SCR in 
accordance with the Scorum Revenue Distribution mechanism. The pool’s 
resources are distributed monthly among authors of the photographs that were 
used in publications and/or comments. The success (in Voting Power) of the 
publication or comment also plays a role. Authors can put their best pictures in 
separate posts and participate in their promotion, thereby influencing the reward 
distribution in two reward pools: for submitting a photograph and for activity as 
an author of the publication.

Technical Overview 
There are three technical blockchain components that make up the Scorum 
sports media platform: the blockchain protocol, Web infrastructure and data 
analytics services. 

Blockchain Protocol 
The blockchain protocol is the most essential part of the Scorum project. Any 
public blockchain must contain economic stimuli aimed at rewarding those 
project participants that support the protocol as well as penalties for those who 
try to compromise it.  

Because of the the technical complexity of modeling and development of the 
unique economic system of the Scorum blockchain protocol, we have decided to 
rely on ready-made solutions whenever possible. Many of the technical 
components of blockchain models similar to Scorum have already been 
developed and successfully used in other projects. We have picked what we 
believe to be the best blockchain solutions available and applied them to the 
development of Scorum.  

The Graphene framework is used to develop the blockchain protocol for Scorum. 
This solution has already proved itself both reliable and highly capable in such 
successful blockchain projects as Bitshares, Steemit, and Golos.  

The Scorum blockchain uses the DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) consensus 
algorithm. The key advantage of this algorithm is its high-traffic network capacity 
of up to 10 000 transactions per second. Such performance is made possible 
thanks to a combination of several factors: 

�  36



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

1. The schedule for the nodes signing blocks is known ahead of time. 

2. Effective transaction processing in each node. 

3. All data necessary for validating transactions is stored in the memory. 

At Scorum blockchain, production of new blocks is made by delegates and takes 
place according to the schedule made for the following round. The schedule for 
each round is made according to the protocol. More specifically, 21 delegates are 
chosen who will be signing the blocks. 20 of them are chosen according to user 
votes. 1 of them is selected from the delegate queue; the delegate with the 
largest number of Scorum Power tokens gets chosen for the upcoming block 
signing round. Each user can participate in block signing thereby playing an 
active role in the decision making process of what type of information becomes 
part of the Scorum blockchain. 

In order to make it to the list of 21 delegates chosen to sign blocks for the 
following round, a user needs to either become one of the top 20 most popular 
candidates according to user votes OR buy a sufficient amount of Scorum Power 
and wait for their turn in the queue among all the remaining candidates that didn’t 
make it to the top-20 list. 

Block production synchronization among delegates (witnesses) is carried out 
according to the NTP protocol which is being used successfully in other 
blockchain systems (Bitshares, Steemit and Golos). 

In order to provide users with an opportunity to perform transactions within the 
Scorum blockchain network without having to spend their resources, we came up 
with the free transaction model for the platform which is made possible by the 
system dynamically calculating bandwidth capacity of each user. 

Blockchain protocol is a set of technology solutions responsible for both 
development and proper execution of user interaction protocol inside a 

�  37



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

specialized p2p network. Blockchain also develops protocol rules and makes 
sure they are executed by a client supporting the protocol. In this case, the client 
is a cross-platform application with an open source code publicly available for 
analysis and use by any interested parties.  

To make the Scorum blockchain deployment process more convenient, we 
provide each new protocol version as a Docker image which allows us to avoid 
the peculiarities of various operating systems and environments. This in turn 
allows our users to easily utilize the client, which is especially important for 
delegates who need to keep the nodes active within the network in order to take 
part in block production rounds. These Docker images of public nodes are also 
deeply integrated into the system of continuous Web infrastructure expansion of 
the Scorum platform. 

Web Infrastructure 
A console application is sufficient for interacting with the blockchain Scorum 
node. However, manual formatting and sending of the transaction in accordance 
with the protocol is far from user-friendly. That’s why developing a convenient 
and secure user interface is one of our key development objectives. 

To allow for seamless and quick access to Scorum web interface, we will create 
a cluster of various containers within the Windows Azure cloud.   

● We use Azure Container Service to expand, support and orchestrate the 
Docker-container cluster with Scorum blockchain nodes. This highly reliable 
solution allows us to ensure availability even during peak load times as well 
as flexibly scale the cluster depending on incoming request volume. 

● Azure Search allows Scorum users to effectively search through the content 
found on Scorum blockchain. To do this, we keep an eye on all the notes 
located in the blockchain and create indexes for them in Azure Search. Such 

�  38



Scorum White Paper                             www.scorumcoins.com
�  

indexing allows us to provide users with the most relevant search results 
considering such criteria as user language and variability of the searched 
phrase.   

● We use Azure Content Delivery Network to allow users to load pages 
immediately, regardless of where they are in the world. 

Justification for The Models 
Used 
Two fully functional products built using Blockchain technology, Steemit and 
Golos, with the blogging components analogous to Scorum, have already 
demonstrated their market success.  

According to CoinMarketCap, as of September, 2017, Steem is one of the top 20 
largest cryptocurrencies with market capitalization reaching $315M USD. While 
Golos, in its turn, is a successful localized version of Steemit demonstrating 
dynamic growth.  

We have taken certain elements from these projects and applied them to 
Scorum. Namely: 

1. The general idea of income distribution among users. 

2. A fair payout distribution model. 

3. Technical components of the platform, particularly the DPoS consensus. 

At the same time, we have significantly improved and adapted the above models 
to the needs of the sports industry and have greatly enhanced the economic 
component of the platform:

�  

1. Introducing advertising inside the platform. Striving to create a sustainable 
ecosystem at Scorum, we have introduced an option to purchase advertising 
in SCR with prices starting at lower rate than the market average. This 
measure is aimed at protecting the SCR exchange rate from volatility. 

2. Additional opportunities to use SCR which is expected to help further 
increase token value.  

3. Finite SCR and SP emission which increases SCR value. 

4. Economically viable existence of the R&D center which is supported by 
stable sources of income (see the "Basics of Scorum Economic Model" for 
details).  

5. Operating costs to support the Scorum ecosystem are substantially 
decreased as the R&D center is located in Minsk, Belarus, where it is 
possible to create technology products of the highest quality at low prices. 

Reasons to Participate in the 
Scorum Token Crowdsale   
Compared to traditional sports media, the Scorum project offers sports fans a 
multitude of benefits. Our unique value proposition will lead to large sports 
audiences choosing our platform over the established media, which is expected 
to result in quick Scorum tokens distribution. In turn, the economy of the Scorum 
project is based on a stable monetization system which gives SCR real value. 

Here are the defining factors that make SCR cryptocurrency attractive to token 
purchasers: 

1. Favorable conditions to forecast SCR value and utility.

● Extensive sports betting market. According to data cited by the BBC, 
the fiat betting market is valued at 1 trillion USD. This money is 
allocated among traditional sports betting platforms where 
commission fees can be as high as 10%. We can assume that users 
will migrate away from traditional venues and towards commission-
free projects. Thanks to blockchain technology, Scorum allows its 
users to make commission-free bets. 

● After launching CPC advertising system nominal value of one click on 
the Scorum platform will be 0.01 USD, whereas other traffic providers 
charge as much as 50 USD per click (the data can be verified via  
Google Adwords). This will significantly increase the platform’s 
attractiveness for advertisers and leads to an increased demand for 
SCR. 

● Discounts for our partners’ sporting goods and services offered to 
those users who choose to pay for them in SCR, which further 
increases the demand for SCR tokens. 

2. According to 2016 estimates by the University of Cambridge, the number of 
cryptocurrency holders had reached 5.8M. However high the number may be 
today, Scorum has potential to expand cryptocurrency user audience up to 
1 billion people by providing inherent advantages for its users: 

● Users can easily enjoy taking part in Scorum's cryptocurrency economy 
which rewards their everyday interests with tangible and 
straightforward benefits. 

● Minimal barriers to entry: user becomes Scorum Power owner right 
after registering at Scorum.
