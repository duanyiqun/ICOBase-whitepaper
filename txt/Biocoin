1.  Abstract

BioCoin, an international blockchain platform and BIO cryptocurrency, is a system of 
mutual settlements, which allows to accelerate the pace of development and increase 
the turnover of all businesses that have joined the platform. BIO is the first crypto 
currency to integrate into the real economy, into the everyday life of people. The 
basis for the distribution of biocoin in the domain of real economic activity is the 
system of loyalty. This is the most important and central tool of biocoin.

The main objective of the platform is to unite socially responsible businesses that 
support organic agriculture, local farms, responsible attitude to the environment, 
contribute to the sustainable development of the planet in accordance with the 
principles of a green economy. BioCoin supports and develops local communities, 
farmers, producers and sellers of pure natural products through an international 
loyalty system.

BioCoin is a living ecosystem. About 20 million biocoins are already in daily turnover.

How does BioCoin work? 
Within the loyalty system, biocoins are accepted for payment by all participants of the 
platform. Customers receive biocoins as a reward for the purchase of goods and 
services. With these biocoins, customers and businesses can settle with each other or 
pay for new goods and services. In addition, biocoins are already accepted for 
payment in a number of businesses without the entry of business itself into the 
loyalty network. And one more innovative component of biocoin is the opportunity to 
pay with them in general anywhere with the help of a crypto-technological solution 
that connects your wallet and MasterCard.

The most important feature of biocoin is the logic of its spread and the growth of 
liquidity in the market. In addition to acquiring biocoins during the ICO or subsequent 
purchase on exchanges, you can get BIO either as payment for goods and services, 
or, more importantly, as a reward for the purchase of goods and services. Such a 
"consumer mining" will promote sales growth among business participants of the 
platform, because this is an opportunity to get biokoins for free. In turn, this leads to 
the joining of new businesses in the platform and causes an increase in the turnover 
of biocoins, so that the demand for biocoins on exchanges is growing, and the price 
of biocoin is rising. And the higher the price, the higher the motivation of buyers to 
do the "consumer mining" and spend their money. Thus, there is a constant increase 
in the cost of biocoin, the growth of businesses and customers who use it.

That leads to an acceleration in the pace of business development, whose activities 
are aimed at developing responsible attitude to the environment and green economy. 
In addition, our technological solution includes the possibility of creating mutual 
assistance banks and to microcredit. Interconnected users of biocoin (friends, 
neighbors, colleagues, partners, etc.) will be able to create small funds for lending to 
each other. This will be another incentive for using biocoins and for accelerating 
business processes within all organizations and communities using biocoin. The 
international blockchain platform BioCoin and the BIO cryptocurrency is a system of 
mutual settlements that integrates into the daily life of people. And makes the world 
better every day.

3.  Introduction 

BioCoin is an international blockchain-based loyalty platform and eco-cryptocurrency 
(BIO). It aims to create a network of socially responsible companies all over the world, 
which, through their activities, support organic farming, local family farms and 
responsible attitudes towards the environment, and also contribute to the planet's 
sustainable development according to the principles of a green economy. BioCoin
was created by the LavkaLavka farmer cooperative founded in 2009. LavkaLavka and 
our partners from different countries (UAZ, ZHITZ distillery, BROTECH Fermentation 
technology, Good Faith Restaurant Group, Living Craftworks and others) have fully 
become the participants of BioCoin from the very beginning of the blockchain-based 
loyalty platform and the eco-cryptocurrency launch.

It is important that the BioCoin ecosystem is already operational in test mode. In the 
run-up to the ICO, 20 million BioCoins were launched into the business of LavkaLavka 
and its partners that joined the platform. We considered it important to allocate a 
strictly limited budget (no more than 20 million BioCoins) for the system testing. And 
now BioCoin already works. Farmers receive BioCoins for their produce and use them 
to pay for the machinery and equipment they need (since the machinery 
manufacturers have already joined the platform); they buy feed, fertilizers and plant 
protection products. Customers already use BioCoins to pay in shops, farmer's 
markets and cafes. They buy goods such as food, furniture and clothes. Transactions 
in BioCoins occur daily and, what should be underlined, it is not merely the result of 
purely financial transactions detached from the real economy. BioCoin is already part 
of the real sector today, part of the real economic activity of people. Activity aimed at 
the sustainable development of local communities, farmers and enterprises that 
support environmental and green technologies. 

Basic principles of BioCoin:
• All clients of the stores, restaurants and other business projects that have joined 

the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme will receive rewards credited in 
BIO cryptocurrency to their personal cryptowallet for every purchase made at 
these establishments. The remuneration is 10% of the purchase amount in the 
national currency (10% is the average number. Each business has the right to set 
the amount of remuneration). The amount of BIO credited is calculated based on 
the cryptocurrency exchange rate at the time of the purchase. Rewards are 
credited to all clients without any exception. It does not depend on the actions of 
the client themselves - since their ID in the loyalty system is connected to their 
cryptowallet through the blockchain-module and the transaction occurs 
automatically.

In case the client wants to pay with the accumulated points turned into a 
cryptocurrency, they can do so with their ID in the loyalty system, or by direct 
transfer of BioCoins from their own wallet to the seller's. 

• Businesses that have joined the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme can 
accept not only national currency but also cryptocurrencies, e.g. Bitcoins or others 
(LavkaLavka is already doing that). Upon payment in cryptocurrency, clients also 
receive a reward in BIO equal to 10% of the amount spent credited to their 
cryptowallets. The technological solution that enables the acceptance of payments 
in cryptocurrencies efficiently and legally is part of the BioCoin blockchain-based 
loyalty programme. 

• BioCoins are accepted without restrictions as payment by businesses that joined 
the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme, along with the national currency 
and other cryptocurrencies. 

• After the ICO, the BioCoin cryptocurrency will be listed on cryptocurrency 
exchanges. 

• All BioCoins to be credited to clients as rewards shall be purchased at 
cryptocurrency exchanges by businesses that joined the blockchain-based loyalty 
programme. The amount of BioCoins to be purchased will depend on the turnover 
growth of each business. 

• Creators of the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme provide free access to 
all businesses that share the ethical principles of the platform. Our goal is to reach 
the maximum number of clients using the platform and increase circulation of the 
BioCoin cryptocurrency. 

• A total of 1 billion BioCoins was released during the emission. No further BioCoins
will be issued. The BioCoin market value will increase naturally as the number of 
currency users grows, the currency circulation within the platform increases, and 
the need to purchase it from businesses-participants of the platform at 
cryptocurrency exchanges grows. The exchange rate of BIO within the blockchain-
based loyalty programme will increase in accordance with the currency exchange 
rate. Each business project that joined the platform will have the right to 
independently set the internal BioCoin exchange rate, being guided by the current 
daily exchange rates. 

4.  Business model

BioCoin's key to success
BioCoin is a beneficial instrument for investors who buy BioCoin during an ICO, for 
business-participants of the blockchain-based loyalty programme, for customers who 
buy farmers' organic produce, and, of course, for farmers themselves and eco-
producers.

The platform allows businesses to acquire new customers while avoiding discount-
based losses, since all BioCoins awarded to customers return to businesses and can 
be further used at their discretion. 
Customers get an interesting financial tool, making purchases cheaper and allowing 
them to earn on the difference of the BIO cryptocurrency exchange rate. Thanks to 
BioCoin, farmers and small eco-friendly producers acquire a growing customer base 
from all around the world. 

Further details:
• We create a replicable system of exchanging fiat money for BioCoins, in which 

conversion happens automatically at every purchase. Conversion is embedded into 
the logic of the blockchain-based platform: during each purchase there is an 
automatic transfer of information about the transaction with the help of each 
cutomer's personal ID to the BioCoin blockchain-module, after which BioCoins are 
transferred to the customer's cryptowallet as a reward for the purchase. Every 
business that joins the BioCoin loyalty platform has its wallet, to which it initially 
buys BIO and, instead of virtual points and bonuses, uses them to transfer to 
customers for concluded purchases. It receives BioCoins back from the customers, 
when they use them to pay into the business, and the coins go in the same wallet. 

• We equip the platform for the opportunity to make payments not only with real 
money, but also with cryptocurrencies.  This could be Bitcoins or other 
cryptocurrencies – we are constantly working on adding as many types of 
cryptocurrencies as possible. Thus, we expand our customer base to holders of 
other cryptocurrencies, who then receive BioCoins. 

• This platform functions in various countries. At the very outset it will be available in 
Russia, the USA, Italy, Germany, and Japan. 

• Our loyalty system and BioCoins are beneficial for businesses from all over the 
world.

• After all, we offer access to BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme free of 
charge. Businesses receive a working marketing mechanism for communicating 
with clients. And thanks to the algorithm of redemption and allocation of BioCoins, 
businesses do not incur discount-based losses. Customers will return all allocated 
BioCoins back to the business by purchasing goods. If necessary, businesses can 
sell BioCoins at the exchange or put them into circulation. Let us give an example. 
A business bought 50 BioCoins for 1 dollar at the exchange in order to credit its 
customer and then did so.  Later on, the customer returned the same 50 BioCoins
to the business. After some time, the price for those 50 BioCoins amounted to 2 
dollars. And like that, the business returned and multiplied its costs related to the 
first "discount" for the customer. The "discount" became a separate financial tool 
bringing profit at the expense of the BioCoin platform. More information here.

• Businesses from different countries that share common values get free access to 
each other's audiences. This leads to marketing synergies.

• In the future, once the platform becomes more developed and the number of 
participants increases, there will be an opportunity to make international payments 
in BioCoins between farmers' cooperatives and all platform users. We call it a 
cumulative financial effect.

Every client who receives BioCoins as reward points is able to:
a) use the BIO cryptocurrency as means of payment in the network of BioCoin 
platform participants;
b) use BIO as an asset whose price is growing. The stock exchange value of BIO will 
increase as the partner network of the BioCoin platform expands, which is the main 
goal of the project team. 

The only way to restock BioCoins for the ever-growing number of customers is 
to buy them at the exchange. 

BioCoin is more than just a business. It is more than just an investment. It is an 
invaluable aid to local farmers and producers, which they are deprived of because of 
the complexities of the financial and credit systems of states. This is support of the 
development of organic agriculture around the world and the promotion of 
sustainable and stable development of the planet and global society. 

4.1  How it works

We issue BioCoin (BIO) cryptocurrency based on the Peercoin fork derived from 
Bitcoin. In total 1 billion tokens. During the ICO, 800 million BioCoins will be sold at a 
price of $1 for 35 BIO (a discount programme during PreSale and the first week of ICO 
is also provided). 140 million BIO will remain in the project team. 20 million BIO have 
already been put into circulation for testing the BioCoin ecosystem. It is very 
important to note that farmers are already using BioCoins, which they received for 
supplying their own products to LavkaLavka, as well as some customers and 
businesses that have already joined the platform. BioCoins are already the reality of 
our days. 32 million BIO is allocated for marketing and promotion of the BioCoin 
platform. 8 million BIO - for the Bounty campaign. This will be the only emission. 

BioCoins will be purchased at the exchange at the current market price.  The BioCoin 
exchange rate will determine the daily rate within the platform used for customer 
transactions.

The higher the circulation of BioCoins within the platform , the higher the demand for 
them will be. Every month, demand for BioCoins will grow due to the introduction of 
new loyalty platform participants and the expansion of the client base of existing 
partners. Whenever necessary, businesses that are part of the BioCoin loyalty 
platform will place bids on the exchange for purchasing the necessary amount of 
BioCoins in order to transfer them subsequently to the wallets of customers buying 
farm products within the platform.
New BioCoins within the loyalty programme of a business will appear only in one way 
- by buying BioCoins on the exchange from their holders (investors). For customers, 
this will be a regular purchase, the result of which be BioCoins credited to their 
electronic wallets as reward points. Customers can use them to pay for purchases in 
stores, markets, cafes, restaurants and other businesses participants of the 
blockchain-based platform.
The more new participants from around the world join the platform, the faster 
BioCoins will be purchased from holders, and in bigger volumes.

Projected increase in the circulation of BioCoins among platform participants around the world from 2017 until 2020:

2017 - 30 million BIO | 2018 - 150 million BIO | 2019  - 400 million BIO | 2020 - 700 million BIO

The forecast of the circulation of the cryptocurrency is based on the analysis of the 
turnover of the whole LavkaLavka cooperative and the business partners of the 
platform and the declared figures, according to which the BioCoins will be credited to 
the clients of these business projects as part of the loyalty programme. 

As a result, we get a self-developing system that allows investors to initiate new 
growth mechanisms for all businesses participants of the BioCoin platform as well as 
for BioCoin liquidity.

This is a growth strategy for businesses, aimed at creating an economic 
alternative to corporate capital and shifting towards sustainable development 
and a green economy. 

What is the main difference between the BioCoin and many other previously 
known cryptocurrencies?
1. BioCoin is already backed by real farm and other natural and pure products at the 

moment of issuance. It can be immediately used as a method of payment and 
exchanged for farm products or food in restaurants in many locations around the 
world. 

2. It is an instrument for investing in the real economy, namely in small family farms. 
3. It has an embedded mechanism of natural currency user growth. 
4. By itself it is a profit-making business tool, as the cryptocurrency nature implies 

that it is constantly purchased from investors.
5. At the end of 2017, BioCoin will enter cryptocurrency exchanges.
6. It is accepted as payment in all LavkaLavka stores, cafes and restaurants, as well 

as stores, cafes, restaurants and farmer cooperatives from other countries that 
have joined the BioCoin  platform. 

7. By integrating into the blockchain-platform, it becomes possible to accept other 
cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. BioCoins are awarded to those who can 
be called "advanced cryptousers".

8. BioCoin is also a social tool. BioCoins contribute to the development of small 
family farms, reviving remote villages that have been slowly dying over the past 
decades. BioCoin is an instrument of sustainable development of territories and 
organic agriculture. 

4.2. Building on the success of LavkaLavka 

The farmer cooperative LavkaLavka was established in 2009. Now it unites over 200 
small family farms located in Russia, Armenia, Greece and Italy. The LavkaLavka brand 
represents healthy products grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers by 
farmers who care about the environment and revive forgotten varieties of fruits and 
vegetables, local breeds of animals, traditional crafts and rural life. All products are 
produced in small amounts with enthusiasm and genuine love for the work being 
done.

LavkaLavka today: Online shop at lavkalavka.com, 6 stores, 3 cafes, 2 restaurants, a 
workshop and farmers market in Moscow, a farm hub with procurement shops and a 
market in the Tula Region, a production cluster for processing bioresources in the 
Murmansk Region on the coast of the Barents Sea in the famous village of Teriberka. 
The cooperative is going to open 5 more cafe-shops in a few months. 

Key facts you should know about us.

In 2009, when we started working as farmers-enthusiasts, our annual turnover 
amounted to approximately 1 million rubles. By 2016, we had an annual turnover of 
around 400 million rubles.  This means that over these years we have grown by a 
factor of 400! In 2012, Google featured us in its advertising campaign. 

Our activities are regulated by our internal standard, which is based on global 
organic certification practices and at the same time is a much broader and more 
socially-oriented document. We only work with small family farms. We do not work 
with large commercial farms and corporations. Our Expertise service carries out over 
100 inspections annually. We support local farmers and believe that the less our food 
is being transported, the better it is for us! We follow the principles of fair trade, 
sustainable development and responsible consumption. We believe that food is not 
just nutrition - it is the most powerful tool to make an impact on the environment. All 
our activities are aimed at supporting small, local, family-run farms that respect the 
environment and interests of local communities.

LavkaLavka is an active member of the Slow Food international movement that 
supports the preservation of agricultural traditions and protects the interests of local 
communities. In addition, we are an official member of IFOAM Organics
International, a public organization uniting all major players on the organic market. 
In 2016, the founder of LavkaLavka, Boris Akimov, was invited to speak at the UN, 
where he gave a presentation on the farmer cooperative. The UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has twice showcased LavkaLavka's experience as an 
example of successful cooperation and development of small family organic farming, 
which should be scaled up across the entire planet. 

In our work, we devote great attention to social aspects. One example is our project 
in Teriberka village on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Teriberka is a small village in the 
Arctic that had been slowly fading away and was soon to disappear. As a result of our 
work, the village has changed dramatically. In 2016, FAO representatives visited our 
Festival of Territory Development in Teriberka and branded our project "an 
example for the whole world".
LavkaLavka will soon add northern berries and sea salt from the region to its product 
offering. All these products will be produced by the people of the Russian Arctic at 
new enterprises that are built there by our cooperative. 
At LavkaLavka, we believe that business can and must be socially oriented and aimed 
not only at earning income but also at changing the world for the better! 
Support local farmers!

LavkaLavka already accepts cryptocurrencies
In the summer of 2017, the LavkaLavka cooperative started accepting 
cryptocurrencies as payment in all its shops, cafes and markets. We started with 
BitCoins, and then continued with ETH, SIB, WAVES, etc. Most importantly, we 
managed to solve all technological and legal problems related to cryptocurrency 
payments. We made sure that anyone can visit our website, shop or cafe and quickly 
pay for products or dishes with Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. No need to wait: 
the purchase is made immediately. Everything is absolutely safe from a legal 
standpoint and follows applicable laws, since after the payment is made with Bitcoins 
according to the national currency exchange rate, we print a check and pay all taxes 
for that purchase. It is this technological solution ensuring the speed and legality of 
payments in cryptocurrency that will be incorporated into the BioCoin blockchain
platform and made available for participants around the world. Representatives of 
LavkaLavka were summoned to the Office of Public Prosecutor soon after they 
started accepting cryptocurrencies. The result of the inspection was that no violations 
were found and the cooperative continued accepting cryptocurrencies.

4.3. Why it is beneficial to entrepreneurs 

With the growth of the BioCoin exchange rate, the client will be able to receive more 
and more products - this is the best motivation for the customer to return to the 
store or cafe - after all, the customer receives money free of charge for purchases of 
farm food, other goods and services.  The platform allows businesses to acquire new 
customers while avoiding discount-based losses, since all BioCoins awarded to 
customers return to businesses and can be further used at their discretion. At the 
same time, if the exchange rate increases, then business not only doesn't lose, but 
also has additional earnings on the growing BioCoin. In addition, we provide free of 
charge access to the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme to all businesses 
that share the ethical principles of the platform. Accordingly, businesses have a free 
marketing tool to attract new customers who learn about it from the BioCoin partner 
network.
You can see more about how's it beneficial for business HERE. 
We have already started integrating projects from other countries that share our 
values into our BioCoin platform.  Those include restaurants with organic food in the 
USA, farmer cooperatives in Italy and Germany. Shops and restaurants in Russia, 
Europe and Asia.

Talks are also underway with Slow Food and IFOAM regarding the possibility of

4.4.  Why it is beneficial to farmers and consumers

BioCoins are based on the real economy and contribute to its development. BioCoins
are a development instrument of farmers' ecosystem. They help address the issue of 
attracting financial resources to farming and organic agriculture, and gain 
momentum for further development. BioCoins received by farmers today will 
increase in value tomorrow and help farmers grow much more rapidly. 
Consumers of farm products receive real cryptocurrency as a bonus and when its 
value goes up, products for them automatically become cheaper. 10 BioCoins
credited to you as reward points when their exchange rate is X dollars may increase in 
value up to 2*X dollars over time. 

Forecast of BIO users in the world:

Customers of cooperative LavkaLavka and partner clients all over the world

About half of the 50,000 BioCoin users in 2017 should be made up by customers of 
LavkaLavka stores and markets and guests of LavkaLavka restaurants and cafes. The 
second half - customers and clients of businesses that will join the platform before 
the end of 2017. Even now, during the preparation for the ICO, several new 
businesses join the platform every day. You can see the offer for partners here. 

5.  ICO

The development of the platform and the BioCoin currency provides new 
opportunities and helps increase sales for farmers who struggle to grow their 
business within the current framework of a "big corporate economy" controlled by 
large retail chains and agro-holdings. 
We are attracting funds to create a financial blockchain-based platform that would 
unite not only farmers, producers, stores and restaurants, but over time the platform 
will be able to bring together all people who share our vision with regard to 
supporting organic agriculture, sustainable development, responsible consumption 
and respect for the environment. 

BioCoin growth will be driven by the development of the blockchain-based loyalty 
platform and introduction of new stores, cafes, markets, restaurants, factories, farm 
hubs and other businesses that provide opportunities for clean products from honest 
farmers to reach the tables of big city dwellers. In addition to that, the growth of the 
platform already comes at the expense of those businesses that share ethical 
principles of the platform, but do not directly engage in food - hotels, innovative car 
companies, equipment manufacturers, and clothing sellers are already joining us. 

5.1. Token specifications

BioCoin is an open source project based on the Peercoin fork derived from Bitcoin to 
provide a long-term scrypt-based cryptocurrency which in turn is based on energy-
efficient cryptographic data.
Biocoin Is real eco crypto. It's based on Peercoin. Peercoin's Proof-of-Stake system 
was developed to address the high energy consumption of bitcoin. For example, as of 
April 2013 the generation of bitcoins was using approximately $150,000 USD per day 
in power consumption costs. The proof-of-stake method of generating coins requires 
very minimal energy consumption; it only requires the energy to run the client 
software on a computer, as opposed to running resource-intensive cryptographic 
hashing functions .

The goal of the ICO is to raise 15 million dollars. 
All funds collected at the ICO will be used for implementing, launching, maintaining 
and promoting the BioCoin blockchain platform: the technological development of 
the platform, expanding its client base, marketing, acquiring new partners, opening 
new outlets, etc. In addition to the costs of creating a blockchain-module that will 
work with all the diversity of loyalty systems in the world and convert points and 
bonuses into BioCoins, the main costs will come from increasing the number of users 
of the BIO cryptocurrency. The involvement of new businesses in the platform and 
development of the most cooperative international network of LavkaLavka farmers 
should create a critical share of users and business projects involved in the use of 
BioCoin. And, thereby, increase the liquidity of BioCoin so as to make it an interesting 
financial instrument, growing in price. The sale of 800 million BioCoins will enable us 
to connect more than 1 million users with the platform by 2020.

7.  Roadmap

Implementation stages of the business project that underpins the ICO
The LavkaLavka cooperative as well as a dozens of other companies have already 
developed a primary technological solution and announced that it can now accept its 
own BIO cryptocurrency, Bitcoins and many other cryptocurrencies at its stores, cafes 
and its online store. BioCoins have already been issued and will be sold at the ICO in 
October 2017. Starting from November 2017, the first version of BioCoin blockchain-
based platform will be launched and our global partners will start joining it. The first 
outlets in the USA, Europe and Asia will start accepting BioCoins.
The currency will be traded at all leading cryptocurrency exchanges. By the end of 
December 2017, absolutely all customers of our LavkaLavka cooperative and our 
global partners will join the BioCoin blockchain-platform and will start using BIO 
cryptocurrency as a method of payment. Meanwhile, investors will be able to start 
selling BioCoins.

Long-term prospects
Once the stage described above has been implemented, we would like to take the 
next step. We can use the blockchain to bring together farmer cooperatives from 
around the world that share our principles. We will be able to certify each farmer and 
use blockchain to track the movement of all their products. This will be a verification 
system for any product created by farmers.
