Ardor is a blockchain-as-a-service-platform that 
evolved from the time-tested Nxt blockchain. It is 
currently successfully running on a testnet and will 
be launched in Q4 2017. The unique parent-child 
chain architecture of Ardor, with a single security 
chain and multiple transactional chains, enables 
three fundamental advantages - reducing block-
chain bloat, providing multiple transactional tokens, 
and hosting ready-to-use interconnected block-
chains. To kickstart the Ardor project and allow it to 
compete with the rapidly-growing blockchain 
market, the development team behind Nxt and Ardor 
decided to conduct a crowdsale for 50 % of IGNIS – 
the token of Ignis, the first Ardor child chain. Jelurida 
will be the corporate entity that will be responsible 
for the development of Ardor and Nxt platform. 

The Ignis child chain will be completely unrestricted 
and decentralised with all features and functionality 
which currently exist on the Nxt blockchain. Multiple 
additional child chains can be created on the Ardor 
platform for various organizations, such as public 
entities, enterprises, consortiums, research institu-
tions, and financial service providers. The platform 
technological innovations make it possible for large 
corporations and SMEs to have a child chain with 
ready-to-use features, instead of creating their own 
blockchain and developing features from scratch. 
Child chains can be implemented in a cost-effective 
way without compromising their security, which is 
guaranteed by the parent Ardor chain.

This document gives a detailed overview of the Ignis  
crowdsale* and the Ardor platform. 
This document gives a detailed overview of the IGNIS  crowdsale and the Ardor platform. The 
aim of the document is not only to present the technical innovation and use cases 
of the upcoming platform, but also to outline the business strategy and development 
roadmap of Jelurida. The terms and conditions for the IGNIS crowdsale  are available 
in a separate document and, due to their legal significance, are integrated in the wallet itself. 

*Please note that the IGNIS crowdsale that is scheduled to commence on 5  August  2017 will distribute JLRDA tokens at  
  ‘I owe you’ basis. The IGNIS tokens will be distributed to JLRDA token holders at 1:1 ratio when the Ardor platform is launched.

Amidst the rush of multiple clones of Bitcoin 
being created in 2013, Nxt was introduced as a 
second-generation cryptocurrency, expanding 
the use of blockchain beyond supporting a cur-
rency and a simple transfer of value. Nxt is the 
first blockchain protocol to use an entirely 
Proof-of-Stake instead of Proof-of-Work consen-
sus mechanism, so its power consumption and 
hardware requirements are very low. Ever since 
the launch, the platform has been running 
securely with 100% uptime and has experienced 
no systematic failure.  Actively used in produc-
tion and in a state of constant development, the 
Nxt platform has been able to stand the test of 
time due to its advanced architecture and solid 
design. Being open source, it has also been sub-
jected to multiple code reviews by independent 
experts from various backgrounds. 

Implemented in Java, the leading industry stan-
dard language for corporate applications, the 
Nxt platform allows for fast prototyping and the 
rapid development of new features. Existing fea-
tures include creating and trading assets, listing 
and buying of digital goods, creating polls with 
very flexible vote counting options, setting up 
conditional transaction execution, assigning 
properties to accounts, sending encrypted mes-
sages, registering aliases, and many others. The 
relative ease with which such new functionality 
has been added regularly by the development 
team every few months during the last three 
years proves the well-designed and flexible 
architecture of the platform. In addition, the rich 
and comprehensive Nxt API which supports over 
200 request types has allowed various projects to 
be built on top of Nxt.

You must be wondering why we are talking about 
Nxt and not about Ignis. Well, there is a connection 
between them so please continue to read further 
to learn about how we came to Ardor and Ignis.

II.1. Existing blockchain technologies have limitations

All platform features, as well as the block generation process, 
require the use of the native token known as NXT.

NXT is not only required for the payment of transaction fees to 
the network and for the transfer of value, but also for all trans-
actions involving the use of the blockchain e.g. pricing of asset 
exchange ask/bid orders, prices of digital goods listed on the 
marketplace, exchange rates of monetary system currencies, 
and the transfer of assets over the blockchain. This makes it 
difficult to develop applications which use the blockchain 
transparently, as ideally, users should not be required to have 
NXT in order to transact and shouldn’t need to denominate the 
value of assets and currencies in NXT. 

Over the course of the development of Nxt, we identified a few problems 
that we needed to address.

Why do all nodes need to be burdened with 
storing and reprocessing all transactions? 

Blockchain bloat is a common problem across all 
blockchain platforms, including Nxt. It is due to 
the fact that every node needs to store all trans-
actions ever processed since the blockchain was 
started. New nodes are also required to re-pro-
cess all data when they download the blockchain 
for the first time. This is a security requirement 
stemming from the trustless design of block-
chain platforms. Being a proof-of-stake crypto-
currency, the balance of an account (its stake) at 
a given blockchain height determines, in a pseu-
do-random manner, whether this account is 
eligible to generate (forge) the next block. For a 
node downloading the blockchain from scratch, 
the only way to verify that the next block it is 
downloading was indeed generated by a legiti-
mate account (i.e. having sufficient stake), is to 
make sure that it calculates and verifies each 
account balance as it downloads the blockchain 
by processing all old transactions it encounters 
during the download. This represents a process-
ing bottleneck that will only get worse as the 
blockchain size increases, especially with the 

rising number of transactions per second. At the 
current transaction processing rate bloat is not 
yet a problem for Nxt, and we have already come 
up with several innovative solutions to reduce it 
even more. One such solution is the prunable 
data function which allows for the removal of 
some data like messages from the blockchain, 
thus reducing its size, yet when needed automat-
ically restoring such data in a trustless manner 
from archival nodes. However, bloat is a serious 
issue that must be solved in a fundamental way 
in order for a blockchain platform to be 
future-proof and truly scalable.

Cloning is simple, but maintenance is not!

Many organizations need a custom blockchain with 
its own transactional token and customized func-
tionality for their needs. To achieve this with the Nxt 
software, an organization needs to create a clone - 
i.e., a completely separate blockchain, running 
a modified version of the software, but not linked in 
any other way to the original Nxt blockchain. Doing 
so requires the setup of servers to process transac-
tions and to secure the network, as well as complex 
development work for the customizations. In addi-
tion to being a burden for most small-to-medium 
businesses, this lowers the system security, as com-
pared to the main public Nxt blockchain. Such 
a clone is also bound to lag behind the latest public 
chain software in terms of feature development and 
security upgrades, since implementation of cus-
tomized blockchains is a complex matter, especially 
if one is not very experienced with the Nxt software.

The above-mentioned problem led the Nxt 
developers to work on a new solution, start-
ing from Q2 of 2016, which gave birth to the 
Ardor protocol. In the Nxt blockchain, it is the 
NXT token that serves this dual purpose, 
being used both to determine forging stake, 
i.e. the right of an account to generate blocks, 
and to execute all kinds of value-transfer 
transactions, i.e. represent a unit of value. In 
Ardor, a separation of these two functions is 
used to achieve much greater flexibility by 
allowing multiple other transactional tokens 
to be used and exist independently; in effect 
allowing child chains to exist and run on the 
same network while operating largely inde-
pendent of each other.

The Ardor platform is based on the stable and 
reliable codebase of Nxt, which has been run-
ning successfully as a public blockchain since 
November 2013. Every existing function of the 
Nxt blockchain will be supported by Ardor. In 
addition, Ardor has a unique design com-
posed of a single parent chain responsible 
for network security and processing, and

multiple child chains responsible for the operational 
transactions such as creating assets, voting on polls, 
sending messages, etc.

Child chains transactions are reported to the parent 
chain using a new process called “bundling”. The bun-
dlers package multiple child chain transactions into a 
single ChildChainBlock transaction on the parent 
chain. The bundlers pay the transaction fees in Ardor 
and receive the transaction fees in the child chain 
coin. 

The first child chain of the Ardor platform is called 
“Ignis”. Ignis will inherit all features found on the Nxt 
blockchain. These features will also be available on 
other child chains, though restrictions can be placed 
by the child chain creators if a certain feature is not 
desired. Unlike “side chains” and other blockchain-re-
lated technologies, the Ardor parent chain and child 
chains like Ignis are based on the same source code 
and share the same security guaranties.

The Ardor parent chain only stores 
transactions which affect the 
balances of the forgers (proof of 
stake block validators). All other 
transactions by child chains are 
pruned, leaving only a cryptographic 
proof (hash) that proves their previ-
ous existence. 

A new node joining the blockchain 
will only need to validate the parent 
chain transactions, which represent 
only a small proportion of all, and 
the transactions of each child chain 
for the past 24 hours, not the full 
transaction history. In addition, a 
new node will load a snapshot of the 
current blockchain state (account 
balances, properties, aliases etc) 
from one of the existing nodes.

Individuals or entities which need 
the full transaction history for their 
own book keeping can still store it by 
setting up an archival node which 
maintains the full transaction histo-
ry based on various conditions. 
These entities will then still be able 
to prove that a given transaction, 
while no longer stored on the block-
chain, was present there in the past.

When assets or currencies are issued 
on top of a child chain, users of these 
tokens pay transaction fees denomi-
nated in the child chain coin, just as 
they would for any other transaction 
on the child chain.

Users of child chains may not even 
be aware that they are using a block-
chain within the Ardor network 
through the API.

Organizations use proven technolo-
gy with the ability to request 
customized features tailored to their 
needs installed by the core develop-
ment team itself. 

For certain applications, a business 
entity managing a child chain may 
choose to cover transaction fees for 
their users by serving as the transac-
tion bundler to make sure that the 
child chain transactions are includ-
ed in the parent chain.

Users of an Ardor child chain will 
only deal with the child chain token 
both for transfer of value and trans-
action fee payment.

A business that needs its own block-
chain does not have to maintain its 
own network of servers, run forging 
and worry about system’s security.

We estimate that this design can 
reduce the number of transactions 
stored on the blockchain at a ratio of 
up to 1:100 without compromising 
network security.

In the future, Ardor child chains may 
even run on their own subnet where 
all nodes except one are disconnect-
ed from the rest of the Ardor plat-
form, thus providing the ability to 
componentize the blockchain into 
domain specific sub-blockchains 
and prevent the need for every 
blockchain node to process all 
blockchain transactions.

Tokens do not have to be a fixed 
amount and child chain owners can 
opt to implement inflation or defla-
tion models, and even more compli-
cated distribution mechanisms. 

In the future, we will make the child 
chain creation process automatic, 
allowing every business or user to 
launch a child chain on their own.

vative blockchain features easily 
available for organizations and their 
user base.

All these features are preserved in Ardor, 
and are available on each child chain.

A child chain can optionally be restrict-
ed not to enable some features.

The parent chain supports a limited 
subset of features, as it is intended to be 
used for consensus establishing only 
and not for everyday transactions.

On each chain transaction fees are 
paid in the native token (coin) of that 
chain. End users do not need to own 
ARDR tokens.

Only the parent chain token (ARDR) 
is used in the proof-of-stake consen-
sus, and thus provides security for 
all child chains. Child chain tokens 
are used as transactional units of 
value only.

Transaction identifiers

Block generation

Bundling

Transaction IDs are 64-bit longs, 
and are globally unique.

The 64-bit transaction IDs are no longer 
guaranteed to be globally unique for child 
chains. 256-bit transaction hashes (sha256 
digests) are used instead as transaction 
identifiers.

A "forging" process is used to create 
new blocks, with the probability of 
block creation dependent on the 
account NXT balance (stake).

N/A

The same forging algorithm is used as in 
Nxt, dependent on ARDR account balances 
only.

A new process, "bundling", is used to group 
child chain transactions into a parent chain 
transaction ("child chain block"), which is 
then included in the parent chain.

Any account can play the role of a bundler. 
The bundling process also performs the 
exchange of fees paid by users in child 
chain tokens into ARDR fees accepted by 
the block forgers.

Phasing

Composite Phasing

By-Property
Voting Model

Transaction execution can be made 
conditional, subject to approval 
using various voting models.

Same voting models as in Nxt, but phasing 
is possible on child chains only. Approval 
transactions can be on a different child 
chain from the phased transaction, and the 
by-transaction voting model also supports 
linking to a transaction hash on a different 
child chain.

Not available, conditional transac-
tions can use only one voting model 
at a time.

The new "Smart Phasing" feature allows 
the conditions for the execution of a 
phased transaction to be combined using 
AND, OR, and NOT Boolean operators, in a 
composite voting model. In this way 
declarative smart contracts can be built on 
top of the already available voting model 
primitives.

N/A A new "by-property" voting model has 
been added, making the execution of a 
phased transaction conditional on its 
sender account having a specified property 
set. This can be combined with the new 
Asset Control feature, to allow only autho-
rized or KYC-verified accounts to transact 
with some asset.

API

Scalability

HTTP query APIs, returning JSON 
formatted response.

Mostly unchanged, except:
1. A "chain" parameter has been added 
to each API that is child chain specific.
2. 64-bit long transaction IDs have been 
replaced with 256-bit hashes.
3. All prices and rates that were previously 
defined relative to the smallest indivisible 
holding amount ("QNT") are now defined 
relative to a unit of the holding (share).

Transactions are stored in the block-
chain permanently, and need to be 
re-downloaded and re-processed by 
every new node, which after months 
and years of operation becomes a 
significant bottleneck.

All child chain transactions will be possible 
to prune completely, without affecting 
blockchain security, thus allowing the 
blockchain size to be kept much smaller. A 
new node joining the network only needs 
to download the parent chain transactions, 
followed by the latest snapshot of the 
current system state.*

With the Ardor platform, the single block-
chain architecture is replaced by a combina-
tion of one forging chain, on which transac-
tions are denominated in one token (ARDR), 
and multiple child chains, each having its 
own transactional token. 

The forging chain supports a very limited set 
of allowed transaction types, such as trans-
fer of ARDR from one account to another, 
trading of ARDR to each of the child chain 
tokens and back, leasing ARDR balances to 
other accounts for the purpose of forging, 
and a special type of "ChildChainBlock" 
transactions. The forging power of each 
account depends on its ARDR balance, in 
exactly the same way it depends on the NXT 
balance on the Nxt platform, with the entire 
consensus model remaining unchanged. 

All transactions that change ARDR balances 
are recorded on the forging chain, and there-
fore downloading and re-processing the 
transactions from the forging chain provides 
exactly the same proof-of-stake security as 
the Nxt platform. However, all transactions 
that only modify child chain token balances, 
or any other account holdings (such as assets 
or currencies), are not recorded on the forging 
chain, but only on their corresponding child 
chains. Thus, the removal ("pruning") of 
those child chain transactions, after they are 
no longer needed, does not affect the block-
chain security, as validity of ARDR account 
balances can always be verified in a trustless 
manner by each node.

The validity of child chain transactions and 
account balances (in native tokens) must also 
be ensured by the platform, and this is done 
by anchoring them to the forging chain by 
means of the above ChildChainBlock transac-
tions. This special transaction type contains, 
as an attachment, a list of one or more trans-
actions belonging to a single child chain, i.e. 
transactions denominated in that child chain 
native token, with their execution affecting 
only account balances and holdings on that 
chain. In effect, such an attachment rep-
resents a "block" on the child chain, although 
no actual forging (block generation) is done 
on child chains. Those attachments are linked 
to the ChildChainBlock transaction by means 
of a cryptographic hash only, thus allowing 
the transaction signature verification to be 
performed even after the actual content of 
the attachment has been pruned after some 
time. This is building upon the design and 
technology already implemented and in pro-
duction use on the Nxt platform. in the form 
of prunable messages and prunable data 
(data cloud), together with a network of spe-
cial-purpose archival nodes to store them.

Each node running the Ardor blockchain validates the 
transactions from all child chains before they are 
pruned. A node downloading the blockchain from 
scratch will no longer be required to fully validate 
child chain transactions that have already been 
pruned as they will only verify their hashes and Child-
ChainBlock transaction signature. However, this does 
not lower the overall blockchain security as it can still 
verify that the accounts that forged the blocks con-
taining them were eligible to forge at that time, and 
therefore those transactions must have been validat-
ed by all up to date nodes while their data was still 
available, in order to get included in the currently-win-
ning (best difficulty) blockchain fork.  

All transactions from all chains must be processed by 
all Ardor nodes and these nodes carry all child chain 
transactions for the last 1440 blocks, until their expira-
tion deadline, or phasing finish height, whichever is 
longer. Child chain transactions will be pruned com-
pletely on nodes not configured to archive them 
longer than this minimum retention period, but those 
that do, known as archival nodes, can opt to store one 
or more child chains longer or indefinitely.

In addition to forging chain transactions and 
blocks, each node needs to store the current 
state of all accounts, as represented by bal-
ances in native child chain tokens, asset and 
monetary system balances, account proper-
ties, aliases, and all other objects and account 
holdings that are created as a result of trans-
actions. Any state that might be needed for 
validation of future transactions must be 
kept. But once the rolling fork resolution limit 
of 720 blocks has passed, older state (i.e. the 
values of such balances and holdings) no 
longer needs to be kept. Such state is being 
removed ("trimmed") even now, however in 
the current system a node that downloads the 
blockchain from scratch is reprocessing all 
past transactions, thus re-creating each past 
state and trimming it as it goes along. In the 
Ardor platform, those old transactions will 
also have been pruned, so re-creating past 
state in order to arrive at current state will no 
longer be possible. To solve this issue, snap-
shots and snapshot propagation will be 
implemented. 

Periodically, each node will calculate a snapshot of 
the state of all derived objects, and a hash of this 
snapshot will be included in the current block by its 
forger. All nodes that are up to date and on the same 
fork already have exactly the same state, and thus will 
be able to verify this hash (and reject the block if inval-
id). A protocol will be defined by which nodes that are 
out of date, or downloading the blockchain from 
scratch, are able to request the latest snapshot from 
up to date nodes, validate it based on its hash being 
included in the blockchain, and download it in a 
decentralized manner. In this way such nodes will 
catch up with the latest system state, bypassing the 
need to re-process all old transactions, that are 
already pruned.

The snapshot data itself does not need to 
propagate through the network when the 
snapshot hash is calculated. Each node that is 
up to date already has the state of all child 
chains, so it can generate such a snapshot for 
itself. It must only validate that the hash the 
forger calculated for the snapshot indeed 
matches its own snapshot. 

Fees on child chains are denominated in the 
chains native tokens, but the forging chain 
block forgers still accept fees in the forging 
token (ARDR) only. To convert fees collected 
in child chain tokens to ARDR, the role of 
"bundlers", or ChildChainBlock creators, has 
been introduced. Any account can serve as a 
creator of a childchain block, provided it is 
willing to accept the fees (in native token) 
collected from the transactions in the Child-
ChainBlock, and in exchange pay the required 
fee (in ARDR) to the forging chain block forger. 
This establishes a market rate for child chain 
token to ARDR token. 

If the fee in native token offered by a transaction 
sender is too low by current market rate, when 
converted to ARDR, no one will be willing to 
bundle such transaction into a ChildChainBlock, 
and the sender must resubmit the transaction 
with a higher fee. If a child chain token loses 
value completely and no-one is willing to 
exchange it to ARDR, transaction processing on 
that child chain will naturally stop - unless some-
one interested in keeping it alive is willing to sub-
sidize it, creating ChildChainBlocks and paying 
the expected ARDR fees to the forgers, while get-
ting worthless (by free market rate) native 
tokens in return. 

Child chains compete with each other for inclu-
sion into a block, since at the end the forgers will 
still look at the fee/size ratio for each transaction 
and will want to maximize their forging profits, 
subject to main chain block size and transaction 
numbers limits.

Structure 

Function

Side chains are independent block-
chains that have a kind of "pegging 
mechanism", where at least one of the 
chains (main chain and side chain) is 
"aware" of the other chain and both 
tokens are pegged at a set ratio. Side 
chains need their own network secu-
rity and block processing.

Transactions executed between the 
locks and unlocks of the main chain 
tokens don't bloat the main chain. 
As the technology of a side chain is 
connected to its main chain, it can 
be used to build on the develop-
ments of the main chain and intro-
duce new features to the market.

"Child Chains" of the Ardor platform 
are tightly integrated into the main 
Ardor parent chain. All transactions 
are processed and secured by the 
parent chain forgers. This makes 
cross-chain transactions possible. 
Pruning will be enabled on child 
chain transactions in order to 
significantly reduce blockchain 
bloat by pruning the transactions on 
regular basis from the blockchain.

Child chains serve as the transac-
tional chains of the parent-child 
architecture, as the parent chain 
retains minimal features. 

III.6 Comparison between Side Chains and Child Chains

Side Chains Ardor Child Chains

We would like to emphasize that side chains and Ardor child chains are not the same. 
The differences are described below:

Risk

Advantage

Side chains are responsible for their 
own security and could be attacked 
if there is not enough mining power 
to secure it. 

If the main chain is compromised, 
the side chain can still operate, 
though its peg will likely lose 
significant value.

Child chains rely on the Ardor parent chain for 
their security, as long as the parent chain has 
enough forging power all child chains are secure. 

• Security is provided by the Ardor parent chain 
and therefore all child chain cooperate to secure 
the same network;
• Child chains can access the same global entities, 
such as assets and currencies;
• Child chain tokens can be securely traded on the 
blockchain;
• Simple to setup (blockchain development skills 
not required);
• Multiple features pre-installed (can be disabled 
on launch if desired).

Use cases

Implemented by 

• Staging for main chain 
   developments;
• Realistic Testnet (funds at risk);
• Semi-centralized chain;
• Pegged chains.

The initial design was published by 
Blockstream in 2014, but the implemen-
tation is blocked by the lack of native 
support for SPV proofs in Bitcoin (which 
may not be added at all). Rootstock 
workaround this by sacrificing decen-
tralization (still work in progress).

• Pegged chains;
• Simple blockchain as a service solution;
• Semi-private blockchain;
• Prototyping and research.

Ardor launch scheduled for Q4 2017.

The ability of child chain tokens to have their indepen-
dent market value, without this affecting the security of 
the whole platform, allows one important use case that 
deserves further mention - the creation of Pegged Child 
Chains. 

Third party businesses can peg the value of their child 
chain token to a fiat currency, or to other cryptocurren-
cy, thus allowing all transactions on this child chain to 
be effectively denominated in that external currency. 
When such pegged child chains are added to the Ardor 
Platofrm, users will have the choice of pricing their 
asset ask/bid orders in fiat, selling their marketplace 
goods with prices in fiat, asset issuers will be able to 
pay dividends calculated in fiat, etc. This opens the 
door to conducting seemless transactions with fiat 
over the blockchain. Furthermore, the existence of 
multiple child chains pegged to different external cur-
rencies will allow users to trade them for each other 
using the Coin Exchange functionality, effectively using 
Ardor as a decentralized foreign exchange ("forex") 
platform.

a. A fully decentralized child chain

While the Ardor platform can have multiple child chains 
with similar features, only the Ignis child chain will be 
created with no restrictions. Other child chain creators 
would have the ability to set certain restrictions, for 
example disabling the decentralized Marketplace 
feature should they prefer to have a centralized market-
place for their business. They may also choose to set 
overall goals or other rules that not everyone may agree 
with, as well as possibly control the supply or future 
distribution of the coins used on their child chain. The 
Ardor platform will be capable of supporting permis-
sioned child chains that can impose further restrictions 
on their users such as KYC, AML, personal data protec-
tion, time-limited data retention, local securities trad-
ing laws for asset issuers, etc. But the Ignis child chain 
will be permissionless, available to the general public, 
with no restrictions on who can transact on it.

b. Increased tradability of the token

The interoperability of the Ardor platform and the 
organic connection between all child chains which will 
exist on the platform will allow the users of Ignis to 
have easy access to the other child chains and benefit 
from the services they may provide inside the plat-
form. While every child chain uses its own coin, objects 
such as assets are global so that assets issued using 
the Ignis child chain can still be traded on all other 

child chains and vice versa. IGNIS can also be traded 
for any other child chain coin as well as ARDR using the 
Coin Exchange feature.

c. How to access the features of Ignis child chain?

IGNIS is the native operational token of Ignis - the first 
child chain of Ardor. In order to access the features of 
the Ignis child chain, users will require the IGNIS 
tokens. In short, IGNIS is the entry point to Ardor – an 
innovative platform built on the solid proven founda-
tion of the Nxt blockchain. IGNIS gives access to the 
rich functionality of the platform and the unrestricted 
features of the permissionless Ignis child chain, such 
as asset exchange, coin exchange, account properties, 
messaging, aliases, marketplace, voting, conditional 
transactions, composite phasing, etc.

Jelurida has identified three primary revenue 
streams based on the Nxt and Ardor blockchain 
protocol. The revenue sources will help Jelurida 
to be a self-sustainable project in the medium to 
long term. 

The unique structure of the Ardor platform will 
allow the creation of customized child chains 
with their own native tokens. Though each child 
chain will come with all features that will be 
found on the Ignis child chain, some features can 
be disabled and additional ones needed for a 
specific child chain can be developed. Even after 
the future implementation of user-created child 
chains, Jelurida will still be able to provide child 
chain creation services, if heavy customization is 
required, such as child chain coin inflation or the 
ability for the child chain creator to generate 
more child chain tokens. Paid maintenance and 
support of the child chains will be a part of this 
service.  Revenue sharing with businesses which 
extract revenue from their child chains (such as 
pegged to real currencies or BTC child chains) is 
another possible income source. 

IV. Business Talk

IV.1 Revenue Sources

a. Child Chain Creation and Customization

Jelurida will provide consulting services such as 
modification of the existing features or building 
custom functionality to fit the needs of each 
client. With this service, the changes applied are 
done by the creators of the platform itself, so it is 
done in an efficient and secure manner. Other 
consulting services will also be available, such as 
the verification of potential use case applications 
with our technology at a high technical level. 
Consulting not only for businesses but also for 
large range of organisations and public authori-
ties about the potential benefits of integrating 
the blockchain technology in their operations. 

b. Consulting

Both Nxt and Ardor, after it launches in early Q4 
2017, will be available for organizations to license 
for private chain solutions. Though it is open 
source, if changes are made and closed sourced, 
a license from Jelurida would be required. 
Private chain licensing will help enterprises not 
only to have a secure private blockchain solution, 
but also to have one directly supported by the 
core developers of the technology, all while being

We will also explore other potential monetiza-

- Paid premium services on the Ardor platform 
like in-wallet ads or charging for promotion of 
certain child chain services in the wallet itself;
 
- Integration of exchanges and payment provid-
ers in the wallet to allow conversion of child 
chain coins to other crypto currencies, pegged to 
fiat or BTC child chains etc., and revenue sharing 
with them.

Wait a second…Why Bundler service?

This is to make sure that the transactions of a child 
chain are included in the parent chain. Of course, 
any user on any child chain can be a bundler, but 
some businesses could prefer to outsource this 
task to a service provider. The same applies 
to tasks like running archival nodes

The financial and banking sectors have undoubtedly been in the last 
years some of the most eager industries to embrace the advantages 
of the blockchain technology. Cross-border transactions, mirror 
accounts, trade finance, money transfer, digitalized payments and 
insurance tracking can all benefit from the distributed and trustless 
nature of the blockchain. Ardor, being written in Java, scalable and 
secure, is the perfect choice not only for the above-mentioned use 
cases but also, thanks to its rich functionality, for asset and securi-
ties issuance, management, trading, and dividend payments.

Payment providers, exchanges, and money trans-
mitters can create a pegged to a fiat currency 
child chain, can provide asset and currency toke-
nization, allowing their clients to transact easily 
on the blockchain in their national currency.

In fact, not only big financial institutions can use 
blockchain such as Ardor in their operations. Due 
to its scalability and the parent-child architecture 
the energy and hardware requirements for using 
a child chain are so minimal that practically even 
SMEs can digitalize their company’s internal pro-
cesses for transparency, security and efficiency 
while the extremely flexible voting feature can be 
used to facilitate the shareholders meetings.

Public authorities, on both local and national 
level, are also experimenting with integrating 
blockchain technology in various sectors like 
tracking of government payments, digital identi-
ty management, real estate or IP recording, 
notarial services and not in the last place - for 
optimizing the highly expensive old-fashioned 
and not so secure way of voting. Legal profes-
sionals can use it for time stamping of docu-
ments, proof of existence, secure messaging, dig-
ital signatures etc.  For all these use cases a highly 
adaptable, flexible and cost-efficient blockchain 
architecture is needed in order to satisfy the 
diversity and complexity of the tasks ahead.  

For example, if KYC or AML procedures are 
required or personal data retention or protection 
need to be in place, the platform has to be able to 
implement that too. The Ardor blockchain is using 
various transaction types which can be easily built 
upon or modified to address such conditions and 
proof of that is the variety of features already 
implemente, tested, and proven on the Nxt block-
chain. 

Other use cases of the Ardor platform can be logis-
tics, parts tracking, mobile roaming, recording of 
system logs events, recording of donations to 
non-profit organizations, traditional crowdfund-
ing, financial return based crowdfunding etc.

Speaking more generally, every time when people 
or organizations need to do business together but 
they do not trust each other, every time when a 
system without single point of failure has to be 
used or immutable ledger is needed, there is a 
room for blockchain technology and the Ardor 
platform fits such needs perfectly.

IGNIS and ARDR will be allocated to user accounts 
in the Ardor genesis block. Their distribution will 
be based on a one-time snapshot conducted over 
the Nxt blockchain, the "Ardor Genesis Snapshot", 
to be performed at least two weeks after the end of 
the last round of the IGNIS crowdsale  and shortly 
before the Ardor launch.

V. Crowdsale details

V.1 IGNIS distribution

From the remaining 500 M (five hundred million) 
IGNIS, 440 M (four hundred and forty million) will 
be offered to the general public in the IGNIS 
crowdsale (conducted using JLRDA tokens at ‘I 
Owe You’ basis ), and 60 M (sixty million) will be 
kept by Jelurida. The funds raised during the 
IGNIS crowdsale will be used for the further 
development, maintenance, advancement, and 
world-wide promotion of the Nxt and Ardor 
blockchain platforms, as well as protecting the 
intellectual property of the code base. The total amount of IGNIS coins issued will be equal to half of the amount of NXT coins existing 

on the Nxt blockchain at the time of the Ardor 
Genesis Snapshot, plus 500 M (five hundred mil-
lion). As already promised, approximately half of 
the IGNIS coins will be reserved and distributed 
automatically to the NXT holders based on their 
account balances at the time of the Ardor Genesis 
Snapshot, at a ratio of 1 NXT : 0.5 IGNIS.

The token sale itself will be conducted on the Nxt 
blockchain platform. A "controllable currency" 
called JLRDA will be issued and offered for sale in 
several consecutive rounds. The price of the 
JLRDA tokens will be denominated in NXT and 
will increase at each round, with full details in the 
table below. Each round will last for one week 
and there will be at least a one-week break 
between subsequent rounds.

V.2 Crowdsale infrastructure 

*JLRDA tokens give the right to receive IGNIS tokens at the time of the Ardor launch. JLRDA tokens are not transferable or tradable 
between accounts and for 1 JLRDA, the crowdsale participant will receive 1 IGNIS at the time of Ardor Genesis Snapshot.

Being a controllable currency, the JLRDA tokens 
will not be tradeable or transferable between 
user accounts. The purchased JLRDA currency 
units will only serve as a proof of ownership and 
initial IGNIS balance for the Ardor Genesis Snap-
shot. A controllable currency was chosen to pre-
vent trades from happening while the token sale 
is ongoing so that purchases of JLRDA directly 
contribute to funding the development of the 
platform.

Purchasing JLRDA tokens will require NXT. Users 
will be able to exchange other cryptocurrencies 
to NXT conveniently within the Nxt wallet using 
the integrated ShapeShift and Changelly third 
party exchanges, subject to availability.

For 1 JLRDA token the participants in the IGNIS crowd-
sale will receive 1 IGNIS coin at the time of the Ardor 
Genesis Snapshot.

The last batch of 100 M JLRDA tokens will be reduced 
by up to 20 M tokens allocated by Jelurida for promo-
tional and marketing use. Jelurida will keep as NXT 
20% (but not more than 40 M NXT) of the NXT coins 
collected in the crowdsale. Jelurida will convert the 
rest of the collected NXT to fiat or BTC, but reserves 
the right to do so in portions, or at a later time 
depending on market conditions.

In case any batch is sold out before the end of the des-
ignated time frame, the next round will still start as 
scheduled. If any batch is not sold completely at the 
end of the designated time frame, the remaining 
unsold JLRDA tokens will be added to the next batch. 
If not all of the JLRDA tokens are sold by the end of the 
last batch, Jelurida reserves the right to decide what 
to do with the unsold amount depending on the out-
come of the crowdsale.

Note: Due to the high market volatility, Jelurida 
reserves the right to postpone or modify the schedule 
of the ICO if the market conditions change significantly.

We believe that we have to be transparent with 
the contributors to the IGNIS crowdsale as well 
as the wider community. So, we will make sure 
that all parties are informed on how we have 
spent the contributed resources which we will be 
collecting through the IGNIS crowdsale. There-
fore, we propose to prepare a Business Report 
that will include information regarding how we 
have spent the contributed money towards the 
development of the company and its technolo-
gies at the end of each fiscal year. We will 
disclose the following information in the Busi-
ness Report to the public on our website:  

1. Percentage of contributed amount spent in the 
preceding year, commencing from the date of the 
conclusion of the IGNIS crowdsale or the last 
report end date

2. Percentage of contributed amount spent on 
product development, in one fiscal year, com-
mencing from the date of the conclusion of the 
IGNIS crowdsale or the last report end date;

3.  Percentage of contributed amount spent on 
marketing and PR expenses, in one fiscal year, 
commencing from the date of the conclusion of 
the IGNIS crowdsale or the last report end date;

4. Percentage of contributed amount spent on 
further research and development, in one fiscal 
year, commencing from the date of the conclusion 
of the IGNIS crowdsale or the last report end date.

Bitswift wants to ensure the security and longevity of their tokens. By migrating them 
to a secure blockchain infrastructure such as Ardor, the Bitswift team can focus on 
utility applications for the Bitswift tokens rather than on blockchain infrastructure 
dealings which is a beast of its own. Through migrating to the Ardor platform we 
inherit a wealth of options for our tokens, most notably a fully featured API from 
which we can build out applications to provide extended utility for our tokens.

Paul Busch, Founder of Bitswift (Future Child Chain on Ardor)

Janus tokens are moving to the Ardor platform as we consider it a natural evolution 
of the project. Increased focus on business with the Ardor Blockchain aligns with our 
company goals of building a multi-industry business empire.

The Janus Project Team (Future Asset on Ardor)

The nice part of Ardor is that it is creating something completely new again and fixes 
issues that most blockchains have, like blockchain-bloat.  A motherchain with multi-
ple child chains. Forging with Ardor for many blockchains is brilliant and could gain 
much attention and brings mining to a new level.

The unique design introduced by the core developers will make it easier for a lot of business and consumers to 
interact with the blockchain. Knowing that there is a development team working for more than two years on the 
concept I am passionate about, I really want to see what the Ardor network can host.

Ruben Bueno Castro, Writer at Nxter Magazine, Community Member since May 2014

Ardor's (child) chains improve scaling even further, by making most transactions prunable. It will allow for cheap 
transactions without compromising security, so that many new exciting applications will become economically 
viable.

Brangdon, Community Member since April 2014

Ardor is ahead of the times. I think in the long term it will be important not only to prevent blockchain bloat, but 
also to offer a simple way creating new blockchains while its users should not worry with the technical difficul-
ties. With the Ardor platform it now becomes possible for basically every business to set up its own blockchain 
without having to worry about security issues. This altogether is quite exciting I think.

Neomadra, Community Member since March 2014

Simply put, the Nxt developers know what there are doing and they always deliver on their promises. I've 
followed the team since the early beginning of Nxt’s existence and the project has advanced the abilities of 
secured decentralized applications tremendously. Nxt is also a green blockchain technology and I like this. I'm 
totally staggered. The Ardor platform is the natural expansion of Nxt where blockchain scalability is addressed. 
Contrary to the Bitcoin scaling solution currently on the table, Ardor's solution improves the global decentraliza-
tion of the network instead of reducing it. The ideas of multiple fully featured child chains is also extremely wel-
comed as this increases the synergy around the Ardor platform. Sincerely, you got to take a deep look at this seri-
ous and impressive project!

Ardor is taking NXT to the next level. Based on more than three years of experience with NXT, the core team 
showed successfully all its genius by developing new concepts that overcome present shortcomings of classic 
cryptocoins. Handling blockchain bloat, scaling, shorter transaction times, implementing smart transactions 
(without neglecting security issues), and separation of forging tokens from transactional tokens come to my 
mind.

eu58 Community Member since Q1 2014

The solved blockchain-bloat problem is a really big thing, not only for NXT/Ardor but also for crypto as a whole. I 
am sure that will lead Ardor to a top position in the BaaS branch.

Logan, Community Member since Q1 2014

I am excited because I believe it solves a simple, but hard problem: scaling and onboarding. Just this month, it 
turned out a lot of value was at risk due to a problem with one smart contract in Parity. Ardor should allow such 
initiatives to enter crypto with less risk.

Bas Wisselink, Nxt Foundation Founder and Advisor, Community Member since December 
2013

I love that the tech has been working without a hitch since the beginning. That track record is unusually good. 
But the great community of Nxt is really above all else what kept me around. The altcoin space in general is very 
toxic and full of spammers (see BitcoinTalk). I imagine that got especially developer-types attracted, that then 
spawned a lot of good projects off- and around Nxt. The use case for the child currencies is so perfect for busi-
nesses and community projects: They can use the infrastructure of Ardor without users having to get the Ardor 
currency.

After almost four years, I still don't know any active cryptocurrency platform that can beat Nxt in versatility and 
accessibility. It can do many things, in a simple way, using a great API, and it works. The Nxt community has been 
also exceptional as think tank and nursery for many cool projects in crypto. A great place to be these years. Ardor 
is literally a new dimension in the ecosystem. And Nxt is a terrific blueprint for custom blockchains
.
Joan Manel Vilaseca, Nxt Foundation Partner, Community Member since December 2013

NXT was, is, and will remain, the ultimate blockchain. But as every blockchain, it is limited by blockchain size, 
which means, in term of long term business planing, despite all you can hear around the blockchains these days, 
due to transactions competition, only business dealing with very high value transactions (or very rare) are safe 
to organize activities around blockchains. The lower, the value of the transactions, the shorter, the duration 
where any activity can survive with the use of blockchains (unless it plans for a decrease of usage frequency). 
With childchain pruning, Ardor is the NXT answer to this limit, it widen the scope of usability, because it largely 
increases the time any business can consider to be able to benefit from the blockchains. In short, Ardor is a cru-
cial step toward mainstream blockchain adoption. It is the step of the dream team that already deployed the 
ultimate blockchain which is running without a single record of incident for nearly 4 years!

which only gives you the right to receive the IGNIS

token and the IGNIS token is final and non-re-
fundable.

The JLRDA token and the IGNIS token do not have 
the legal qualification of a security, since they do 
not give any rights on dividend or interest. The

the IGNIS token cannot have a performance or a 
particular value outside the Nxt and Ardor/Ignis 
blockchain respectively. The purchase and use of 
JLRDA token and the IGNIS token shall therefore 
not be done for speculative usage or investment 
purposes. The purchaser of the JLRDA token and 

IGNIS  token is aware that national securities 
laws, which ensure that investors are sold 
investments that include all the proper disclo-
sures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny for 
investors' protection, are not applicable.

IGNIS token, expressly acknowledge and repre-
sent that (s)he/it have carefully reviewed this
