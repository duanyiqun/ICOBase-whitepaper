Introduction 

The empowerment of individuals through automated systems and social networks is 
disrupting the traditional retail brokerage and investment management models. The 
industry has suffered from the loss of customer trust and low levels of retail participation 
given two key fundamental issues: (i) information asymmetry was driven by the fact that 
the institutional investor has superior information and analytical tools at their disposal 
vis-a-vis the average retail investor; therefore the retail investor is typically on the 
“losing” side of the trade and (ii) inherent conflicts of interest in the traditional financial 
services model.  At its core, The TrakInvest Project is about “Crowdsourcing of Financial 
Wisdom” and rewarding the participants in its decentralized economy based on 
performance and insights.   

Trakinvest, a virtual social trading platform, currently offers (i) users the ability to share 
their investment expertise with other members of the network for a fee, (ii) provides 
“crowdsourced” sentiment, forecasting and prediction tools using innovations in smart 
contracts, machine learning, NLP and artificial intelligence, and (iii) and digital certification 
programs in online trading. Users can access and explore the existing platform at 
www.trakinvest.com.  

TrakInvest is best set up to implement this project and already has a strong three-year 
track record having built up a 100,000+ user base in Asia through its partnerships with 
corporates, universities, and governments in the region. The Platform will also be 
introducing (i) a virtual trading platform for cryptocurrencies and (ii) next generation 
“crowdsourced” sentiment tools for equities and cryptocurrencies. These proprietary tools 
have been developed using the social trading data and behaviour collected for the last 
three years. TrakInvest aims to empower the retail investor with all these tools to create a 
level playing field removing the information asymmetry that has plagued them for so many  
years. 

TrakInvest is poised for strong growth as we look to introduce TRAK Tokens by Q1 2018 to 
our existing user base, thus providing them with the ability to earn service fees in ETH in 
exchange for providing their real-time trading data and sentiments through TrakInvest’s 
web and mobile platforms. Currently, the community continues to provide invaluable 
trading data, insights, and sentiments through the platform by maintaining a virtual 
trading portfolio: www.trakinvest.com. At the application level, the token utilities will 
include: (i) Tokenized data ownership, (ii) Tokenized reputation system, and (iii) Tokenized 
certifications. 

The shift from a centralized technical infrastructure to distributed, ecosystem-enabling 
platforms is laying the foundations for new business models in investment insights and 
financial transaction technologies. Identifying the industry shifts, TrakInvest platform is 
utilizing blockchain technology to create a decentralized peer to peer ecosystem that 
incentivizes members of the community on performing value added services. The rewards, 
incentives, and insight tools encourage the full establishment and continuity of the virtual 
socio-trading environment that rewards for performance, sharing of investment insights 
and real time trading data in a risk free manner. 

By leveraging the blockchain technology, TrakInvest aims to increase the scalability of the 
current platform while enhancing its security and transparency levels. Backed by a 
powerful tech stack and the strength of Ethereum’s Open community network the 
ecosystem has a strong technical foot holding.

Executive Summary 

The current global equity investment system does not favour retail participation given 
information asymmetry and inherent conflicts of interest. Our core intent is to level the 
playing field and shift the model from arbitraging opacity to arbitraging intelligence. 
Trakinvest’s mission is to crowdsource financial wisdom and using big data anlaytics, AI 
and Machine learning share the trading behaviour of the masses with the retail investor, 
thus giving them an edge.  

The incentive to provide investment education, tools and financial benefits to people 
without ready access to capital has been absent for some time. Trakinvest platform seeks 
to empower millennials by (I) providing AI tools to make better informed investment 
decisions and (ii) creating a reward based economy to incentivize people for their data 
and insights, regardless of income, or location. TrakInvest utilizes the concepts of Social 
Trading, Robo-Advisory and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver this value proposition to 
it's growing community of 100,000+ users. 

TrakInvest revolutionizes the traditional investment format by allowing users, regardless of 
their experience, exposure or ability to participate by providing them with transparency 
and “TRAKing” features such as “Copy Trade” to maximize their return potential. 

TrakInvest provides white-labelled solutions for access to its key features for marketing 
and new customer acquisition to companies in the Financial Services Sector. Companies 
train new users or engage existing users to invest in stock markets. With a simulated 
environment across 10 international stock exchanges and over 18,000 stocks, customers 
practice stock investing without losing real money and once confident can invest with real 
money leading to brokerage revenue for our Corporate partners. We provide “white-
labelled” solutions to our Corporate customers that includes our various components and 
tools offered on our web, mobile and messenger applications. TrakInvest’s approach to 
innovation revolves around a learn-share-earn core. The portal is designed to incentivise 
new users and seasoned investors alike through meaningful financial incentives, insights 
and career opportunities. The idea ultimately, is to be the bridge between those with alpha 
generating ability and talent, but limited to no capital, and those with capital but not 
necessarily the time, alpha generation ability or inclination.   

The portal allows users to create groups to share information and insight on equities and 
sectors. It allows users to showcase their level of knowledge on specific sectors and 
stocks, and to learn from others on sectors they want to get better at. The actual trading 
happens in real time during market hours in the markets covered including Singapore, 
Hong Kong, and China, India, Australia, and the US, and that forms the basis of their 
investment track record. In Q1 2018 TrakInvest will be introducing a similar product to also 
trade crypto-currencies. 

As new users gain confidence and showcase their track record, they can gain users who 
“TRAK” them. For all users, seasoned investors and others, the portal provides a 
substantial financial incentive to “TRAK” and to be “TRAKed”. That incentive is four-fold:  

i. Users are provided with a recommendation engine suggesting Top Traders and 
Ideas.  Using the TRAK Tokens the participants will seamlessly be able to make 
payments to Top Performers for advice and real time trading data.   

ii. A proprietary TI Score – combining a user’s investment track record with how 
active they are on the social hub — in effect estimating a proxy for their positive

influence on the portal. Your TI Score will determine your “influence” at the 
stock, sector, and market level and will determine the number of Tokens your 
“followers” will contribute to you for sharing your real-time trading activity on 
the Platform. 

iii. Existing Partnerships & Sponsorships with global financial institutions in Asia, 
e.g. Edelweiss Securities, Karvy Securities, HDFC Securities, Siam Commercial 
Bank Securities, Andhra Pradesh Government, Indian Institute of Sciences, and 
other Universities in the region provide the education and career incentives to 
the users and ensure continued engagement with the Platform  

iv. The higher your TI score, the more you will show up in TRAK suggestions, the 
greater the probability of gaining users who TRAK you (remember TI is a 
combination of social activity / impact and investment track record), the greater 
the chances of a high payout on TRAK fees. Similarly, the better your 
performance, the more chances you have of garnering one of the many planned 
internships on offer — which are usually awarded through performance contests 
on the portal, and of actually leveraging participation and showcasing your 
record, into a meaningful career opportunity.  

The first markets TrakInvest has built its operations are India, Singapore and Thailand and 
intends to continue its expansion into Southeast Asia, North Asia and the Middle East in 
2018. TrakInvest is focused on targeting on the Asian market, where the demographic 
dividend will be the key growth factor. With a population of 4.5 bn and 52% online, Asia’s 
middle class population is set to explode, reaching 2 bn by 2025; during the same period 
the disposable income is set to grow 3 times.  

The population of millennials also known as generation Y, has been growing over the past 
years and this year it will be the largest generation ever. Until 2020, the aggregated net 
worth of the global millennials is predicted to more than double compared to 2015, with 
estimates ranging from $19 — $24 trillion. The millennial customer in wealth management 
can broadly be placed in the following 3 categories: 

TrakInvest is addressing the needs of millennial wealth management by providing online 
financial certification courses, financial data, sentiment analysis and AI powered insights to 
enable its users to make better informed trading decisions. 

TrakInvest is building its market by aligning the financial and career incentives of the 
demand and supply sides of the investment markets equation.

Tokenomics 

TrakInvest Token (‘TRAK’ token) is a utility token that can be used to perform a variety of 
activities on the Platform. The demand for the TRAK token is driven by the strong 
pipeline of existing contracts with leading corporates and universities, TrakInvest’s 
continued marketing initiatives including the “The TrakInvest Show," and overall market 
dynamics.  In this section we describe the use cases for the TRAK tokens and provide  
with details of the contracted and projected demand and their key drivers. 

There will be primarily 3 types of utility tokens to engage with TrakInvest for the services 
mentioned above. At the application level, the token utilities include: (I) Tokenized data 
ownership, (ii) Tokenized reputation system, and (iii) Tokenized certifications.

Token Demand Drivers 

The Token drivers that presents compelling reasons to augment the growth of TRAK token 
economy in the next 12 months and have outlined our key assumptions based on our 
existing contracts and conservative forecasts.  
  
The current contracted demand for TrakInvest’s Certification Program is 20,000 students 
receive certification at USD 150 / student. Our current pipeline of students represents less 
than 1% of the annual relevant student population in India looking for job-ready short-term 
certifications. Given our expansion plans for both India and other countries in South East 
Asia and Middle east, the projected demand for Certifications in 2018 is 4x the current 
demand. 

The Platform currently has 100,000 “Traks” being performed by the current user base for 
no monetary incentive.  The price per “Trak” will be the equivalent of USD 1 - 100 per 
“Trak” per month. Given the introduction of the TRAK Tokens we conservatively expect 
this activity to grow 5x from current levels in 2018.   

The projected growth in the total user base is projected to 3x our current levels driven by 
our launch of the TrakInvest Show Season 2 (India), launch of Siam Commercial Bank 
Investment Centre and investment labs at Universities in Thailand and India.  We expect 
the projected growth multiples to increase as we roll-out in other countries in the region. 

Introduction of the AI Sentiment Tool for equities and cryptocurrencies available to retail 
and institutional investors and the introduction of the marketplace will represent “upside” 
case of demand for the Trak Tokens. Given the strength of token drivers and their potential 
impact on the TRAK token economy, we have constructed 3 scenarios for depicting the 
growth trajectories of the token demand in the graph below-

Use of Proceeds 

TrakInvest ICO is looking to distribute 66 million TRAK tokens denominated in ETH.  The 
proceeds from the ICO will be utilised for product extension and geographical expansion. 

Use of Proceeds 
 

Product and R&D 

Forty percent of the funds raised during the ICO will be allocated to the development of 
product to strengthen the machine learning and robo-advisory features. Algorithms will be 
developed that will automate advisory to build a recommendation engine for customised 
portfolio management for the retail millennial consumer.  

Marketing   

Thirty-five percent of the funds raised will be used for awareness and reach-out to the 
millennials across Asia, which boasts the biggest millennial population in the world. Focus 
will be to build key partnerships with large universities and state governments to access a 
large number of consumers  

Operations 

Teams of trainers, sales, customer support and recruiters will be required to train and 
place the certified candidates. This kind of team will be in place at all the countries where 
TrakInvest is operational and will be there in the next 18 months. 

Legal & Admin 

Although AI, blockchain-based services are growing at an exponential rate, there is still 
ignorance about them and their potential. This can lead to legal requirements failing to 
keep up with the progress of blockchain, even becoming a hindrance in the process. As 
such, to make the TrakInvest Ecosystem available on a global scale, there are some license 
and legal requirements that will need to be met, for which 5% of the funds will be 
allocated.

The Disruption 

The fourth industrial revolution is bringing about the convergence of the physical and 
cybernetic worlds, and the digital technologies that come with it is creating disruptions in 
a previously traditional industry — the financial services industry.  

Innovations led by technology-enabled platforms are disrupting the existing industry 
structures and complex eco-systems. Deep-Diving into the investment management 
landscape, key trends such as robo-advisory, social trading and AI are shaping business 
models, consumer behavior and the entire ecosystem. 

Traditional investment management involves providing personalized advisory solutions to 
the high net-worth individuals. Personal wealth managers with access to sophisticated 
tools and specific information manage the investment portfolios in exchange for charging 
high fees. 

In recent decades, however, such high value advisory services have been automated to 
create cost-effective advisory solutions. These automated advisory solutions known as 
robo-advisory, provide algorithm-based advice at nominal cost. As a result, the services of 
traditional wealth managers have been commoditized and businesses have been forced to 
shift online and move beyond the high-end customer to target the mass affluent 
customers. Refer the WEF report on future of financial services published by Deloitte, 
given in the reference section of this document. 
 

Customer expectations are also shifting, as there is a rising demand for low cost, 
personalized solutions that are hassle free and convenient to access on demand. Further, 
post the financial crisis of 2005-2008, there is an increased sense of distrust for financial 
advisors. In a recent Bloomberg study, over 90% of the millennial population chose non-
traditional methods for managing their personal investments. 

Such an environment is further fuelling the rise of robo-advisors and social trading tools. 
Robo-advisors build trust, transparency and consistency in performance by eliminating

human intervention. Social Trading tools empower individual customers to share 
investment advice and to gain from market insights of the crowd. An overall environment 
of “prosumers” is created where the customers participate in production, competing with 
traditional wealth advisors on generation of better returns on investments. 

Emerging technologies in big data analytics and infrastructure are producing smarter, 
faster machines that are capable of processing large amounts of unstructured data that 
include real-time market events and social media news feeds. Traders can now gain deeper 
insights into specific stocks to correlate market movements rather than just studying price 
movements of a single stock.  

Complex algorithms and trading strategies that incorporate machine learning can be 
developed to churn the vast amounts of data for stock market predictions. Machine 
learning capabilities improve the accuracy of the predictions over time. 

TrakInvest sits at the cusp of these emerging trends in social trading, robo-advisory and AI. 
TrakInvest provides a marketplace for individual investors to share their investment ideas 
and earn fees for doing so. Individual investors learn and gain market insights from their 
peers based on their performance without any other agenda. 

TrakInvest has access to the trading data and behavioral insights of 100,000+ customers as 
a result of their activity on the TrakInvest platform. TrakInvest proprietary algorithms churn 
this data to provide market insights and customized portfolio recommendations to 
individual investors. These recommendations improve over time as algorithms continuously 
incorporate and learn by accessing more and more data. TrakInvest users access all these 
features on demand through easy-to-use, interactive interfaces over web, mobile and social 
media chat-bots.

Technical Architecture 

Trakinvest is built using micro-services architecture. Services in Trakinvest are grouped by 
their functionality and the nature of logic needed. There are 3 types of services in the 
system: Gateways Stateless Services, Batching Services, and Gateways Services that 
enable the web to access our applications. These services include the portal and the chat-
bot. Stateless services are built in such a way that they support horizontal scalability. 
These services have access to the database and are able to perform some business logics 
before returning the values to gateway services. Some of these stateful services are 
storing stateful AKKA actors to make calculation even faster and stateful services have 
direct access to their intended databases. 

Due to the nature of micro-services, we are not bound to specific language/technology. 
However, there's a limitation imposed on the language that we are adopting. At the point 
of writing, we are focusing only on JVM based languages to ensure the performance, 
robustness and stability of the system. Services currently are written in 3 languages: (I) 
Scala, utilizing the PLAY and AKKA frameworks, (ii) Java, utilizing the Spring Boot & 
Ecosystem, (iii) Javascript using the Node and Express.  For the front end development we 
have utilized React, Redux, and Saas/Scss frameworks. 

Services in TrakInvest are deployed in containerised docker images. With dockerized 
application, the platform can easily achieve horizontal scaling without configurations.

Trakinvest AI 
 

TrakInvest has brought the concept of “track records” from the institutional level down to 
the retail level. 

Given advances in natural language processing (NLP) and the explosive growth of online 
prediction communities, rich social investing data sets are making it possible to evaluate 
investors not just by their popularity but also by their historic performance. Two trends 
heighten the importance of accurate measures of investor trust for the always-connected 
modern investor looking for credible trade ideas and information: more retail investors are 
directly managing their own investments in part because of declining trust in traditional 
advisors.   

The three key initiatives in the TrakInvest AI recommendation engine include: (I) Sentiment 
Analysis, (ii) Network Analysis, (iii) Ti Reputation Score. The sections provide a brief 
overview of the various segments and more detailed technical methodology is available on 
request.   

Sentiment Analysis 

This section discusses the framework behind the sentiment analysis engine that will derive 
crowd sentiment from a corpus of documents. The results of this sentiment analysis will 
work in both a push and pull mode. In push mode, news and announcements will trigger a 
push notification to end users based on their interest profile while pull actions will 
empower the end user to query the engine on the current status of a current stock. 

The corpus of information for the sentiment analysis will be retrieved from a blend of time 
sensitive and query-able websites, for which web crawlers are written to derive share 
specific news, mandatory corporate disclosures, public discussion boards and twitter 
feeds. This will be further supplemented by information mined internally from TI’s 
discussion boards to provide an asymmetric advantage in the development of the public 
sentiment.  

Once the textual information has been retrieved, it is then pre-processed for vectorisation. 
A multi-pronged approach is then taken to determine sentiment based on consensus 
readability measure (e.g., Fog Score), lexicon based approaches (bag-of-words using 
Harvard General Inquirer / Loghran and McDonald dictionaries) and machine learning 
methods including Support Vector machines, Random Forests and Deep Neural Networks, 
trained over historical price data of each share of interest. 

Network Analysis 

The recommendations from the sentiment analysis engine will then be supplemented with 
a TI-STOCK score and a TI-TRADER score, which each provide a time sensitive quantitative 
metric by which the traders and stocks can be ranked, specifically based on their 
performance within the TI platform. 

TI Score 

The Ti Score is a combination of the individual’s performance combined with the social 
“relevance” of that performance within the network. As an isolated individual, the TI score

could be defined as a weighted sum of the multiple attributes of a Trader’s behaviour. The 
attributes to consider are for example (i) Total Gain/Loss and current position for Sell 
Orders for a Stock and (ii) Current Position (Profit/Loss) of the Holdings. 

However, when the individual is a part of a network where there are followers and 
followings then it becomes a Graph problem. In this scenario, the TI score may be 
compared to a Page Rank that the Google’s search engine builds behind the scene. In a 
Graph, the attributes of the followers and the followings also get included, for example (i) 
Total Gain/Loss and current position for the Sell Orders of the followers and followings for 
Copied orders for that Stock, (ii) Current Position (Profit/Loss) of the Holdings of the 
Copied Buy Orders that his/her followers and followings executed. 

Additionally, for each person that a Trader follows, there is a degree of influence that he/
she has on the Trader. This influence percolates to other Traders who follow this Trader. 
The TI score thus obtained is a Holistic score, i.e., the Graph’s Overall Influence calculations 
have to converge to a specific set of values.

 is the price for Scrip ’ ’ at time ‘ ’ 

‘ ’ is the rate of interest of used for Net Present Value calculations 

Notes: 

1. All Amounts are measured as a % of Initial Constant Balance (e.g., $100,000), making the 
profit calculations comparable 

2. For a non-zero rate of interest ‘ ’, the value for money would be different depending on 

when the Trader registered on the Platform 

o The rate of interest ‘ ’ may be considered to be zero for simplicity 

3. The Moments of the Distribution need to be considered to account for the variation in a 
Trader’s performance, i.e., Median (v, as unbiased Estimate of Mean) and Standard 
Deviation (sigma) 

o An easy approach there could be to include only those Traders in the Graph 
that have a min # of Orders executed for a particular Scrip, e.g., 30 - "magic" 
number sometimes used by Statisticians
