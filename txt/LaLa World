LALA means being happy and that is truly what we want to achieve – financial 
freedom, financial happiness, and financial accessibility to over 2 billion 

unbanked and underserved. 

The migrant and their unbanked families in emerging and frontier markets have been 
suppressed for  the longest time without any access to basic services, financial or 
otherwise. About 2.4 billion poor people worldwide are often excluded from free 
movement, basic rights which often leads them to corruption, crime, including slavery, 
human trafficking and in extreme cases, death.

Banks, financial institutions and even local financiers do not participate in these markets 
because they are not able to adequately assess price risks. Lack of reliable identification 
systems, financial data, unreliable intermediaries, zero credit history and unpredictable 
legal systems further limit the capital available for financial inclusion at grassroots. This 
uncertainty and severely limited access to financing and other financial products 
cripples’ individuals, micro entrepreneurs, small businesses, stymies growth and 
entrenches poverty. LALA World is all set to change that.

For decades, the current financial system has been controlled and centralised. 
Numerous attempts to create a central clearing system like SWIFT, CHIPS, various 
clearing houses, for domestic and international payments systems etc. are largely 
contractual arrangements between two parties with greater influence by geopolitical 
factors.

Blockchain comes as a blessing 
in disguise to truly create a 
decentralised, peer to peer 
network, distributed among the 
value holders. From humble 
beginnings in 2008, Blockchain 
and cryptocurrencies are 
becoming mainstream today.  
Further, developments in the 
blockchain space continues to 
take place at a faster pace than ever before. Several corporate, governments and 
developers are working on different aspects to improve this technology but there are 
three major aspects of Blockchain being implemented over the next few months which 
we believe will work wonders for LALA World and the unbanked. These are:

1. ABSTRACT

2Copyright 2017 @ LALA WORLD PTE LTD hello@lalaworld.io

80 % of banks predicted to
initiate DLT projects by 2017

Over US$ 1.4 billion in
investments over the past

3 years

90+ central banks engaged in
DLT discussions worldwide

2,500+ patents filled
over the last 3 years

90+ corporations have 
joined blockchain consortia

24+ countries currently
investing in DLT

1. True and immune decentralization: Most people on the planet do not have the 
capability to own large computers, servers or any of the existing sophisticated 
machinery to operate a node in the system, but they do have smartphones.With 
decentralised projects and beginnings of Atomic Swaps, this could truly create a 
decentralised world in the coming years and decades.

2. Scalability and efficiency on-Chain: These two go hand in 
hand. Scalability needs to have a throughput of millions of 
transactions per second, on-chain. And the efficiency must be 
increased by a factor of 80 to 90 in order to be considered 
disruptive while run secure by design. Many solutions are 
being proposed which will further help our cause.

3. Privacy, open and unrestricted access: People work for 
their money and must have full, uncensored and unrestricted 
access to their own money. Banks, capital markets and the 
centralised controls continue to suppress the unbanked. LALA 
is creating that ecosystem to truly revolutionise the way peer 
to peer markets works for this population

With over 2 billion people suffering for so long, financial inclusion is the top agenda 
everywhere today: financial institutions, governments, central banks, NGOs, large 
corporations, and technology companies. So far, various solutions have been tried and 
tested, with or without the involvement of banks, attaining some levels of success. 
According to the World Bank, 700 million of the previously unbanked became account 
holders from 2011 to 2014. However, 2 billion adults globally still remain without an 
account with a bank or even with an authorized non-bank service provider.

BLOCKCHAIN + FINANCIAL INCLUSION = LALA WORLD ECOSYSTEM

No Regulation Instant Settlement No Branches Digital Payments Low Costs and fees

•  Payments and remittance settlement can happen rapidly
   allowing people to access their capital when they need it.
• Time and cost efficiencies could support large amounts of
   small transactions or micro transactions within a trusted
   network

REDUCES SETTLEMENT TIME

Provides real time tracking of transactions in a
decentralized manner  with no double spending or
transaction

ELIMINATES ERROR HANDLING

Secure transaction ledger database which is shared
in an established, distributed network

SECURE TRANSACTION LEDGER DATABASE

• Blockchain supports smart contracts , transactions that include
   multiple assets, transactions that include multiple parties and
   two-way transactions
• This will allow the unbanked not only access to bank accounts
   but access to global capital markets as well by providing all type
   of value transfers

SUPPORT SMART TRANSACTIONS

Storing transactions in an automatically shared, 
tamperproof database could eliminate the need for
complicated procedures and clearing houses and ensure
that banks have their records in sync

“TRUSTED” THIRD PARTY ELIMINATION • Blockchain can cut operational costs which banks are targeting,  
  giving real benefits while reaching out to the real customers and
  not just bank accounts
• Santander predicted that blockchain technologies could reduce
  banks Infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments,
  securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15-20
  billion per annum by 2022

LALA World is an Ecosystem of real life partnerships with governments, NGO’s, local 
communities and an integration of biometrics, blockchain and distributed ledger 

technology that aims towards financial inclusion.

LALA World (“LALA”) is a wholesome ecosystem for the unbanked, starting with the 
migrants and their families back home. The ecosystem not only revolves around 
financial inclusion, but also bringing together communities at grassroots level, solving 
real life issues faced by this population and using the most advanced technology to 
bring everyone together.

The base of this Ecosystem is the LALA Wallet platform. By creating a whole new peer to 
peer infrastructure, LALA aims to revolutionize the way individuals, small businesses and 
micro entrepreneurs transact, make domestic and cross border payments, borrow 
money and associated products like insurances, cards, wealth and other general 
banking products.

The key to LALA’s success is in its experienced team and their global network and 
partnerships. We believe it is all about execution in the end. With relevant experience 
running such projects, monumental partnerships already in place, great technology 
team behind us and ground level support, we believe we are blessed to have all come 
together for LALA. 

To accomplish this herculean task, we need partners. We are aware of our migrant and 
network strength, but also at the same time, aware of our weaknesses. We cannot build 
everything alone. Therefore, LALA has struck various partnerships across Asia, Africa, 
Middle East and CIS. That means real customers, real people and use cases. A fiat 
prototype is being tested across users in Malaysia and India. This will provide us with 
valuable feedback and make the system more robust. An Ethereum and Hyperledger 
based domestic and cross border financial system (LALA Transfer) Proof of Concept 
(PoC) as well as a peer to peer lending platform (LALA Lends) is being developed by our 
highly qualified blockchain developers. That should be complete just before LALA 
Tokens hit the exchanges.

The current financial system is broken for this suppressed population. Several papers, 
articles and theories have been written on this. It has been a herculean task to bring them 
into the mainstream. From a controlled and centralised financial system, LALA is truly 
bringing a whole new ecosystem (financial and grassroots community levels) to 
eliminate the need for intermediaries which drastically reduces costs and creates 
efficiencies. Storing transactions on Blockchain eliminates complicated procedures and 
clearinghouses, saving time, money and the risk of error. The allowance of frictionless 
savings and investments gives people more control over their financial destiny. LALA 
uses Smart Contracts embedded into transactions that further simplify complex 
procurement, negotiation and verification processes.

“We’re going to focus on accelerating investments in human capital, in health, edu-
cation, social protection, so that Africa can prepare itself for the next phase in eco-
nomic development,” – Jim Yong Kim, President World Bank

THE UNDERSERVED & UNBANKED

For more than 2 billion individuals without a
bank account, LALA World provides immediate

access to microfinancing services and cheap,
global remittance services

MIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES

LALA World provides the fastest, cheapest, and
easiest way for migrant workers to send
money home and sustain their families

AID ORGANIZATIONS, NGOS AND GOVERNMENTS

and publicly auditable distribution of funds to
developing countries

TOURISTS AND EXPATS

Insteads of obtaining traveler checks, or
paying excessive conversion fees, visitors
in foreign countries can buy and use any

currency, anywhere in the world



We believe that the economy works best when it works for everyone, this new 
platform is an engine of inclusion.

1. LALA WALLET

LALA Wallet is your single point access to all financial services in the LALA World 
ecosystem. You have multiple top up and cash out options, hold fiat or multiple 
cryptocurrencies, with a host of financial services like money transfer, lending, bill 
payments, cards and other normal banking products at your fingertips. LALA Wallet also 
allows you to share your micro projects globally, allows you to raise issues which are 
suppressing the unbanked and build your own communities, thereby creating a true 
Ecosystem benefiting everyone. 

When you download for the first time, one of the most secure multi-currency wallets is 
automatically created, which the user can then fund with fiat or cryptocurrencies. We are 
also working with various banks and payment processors across geographies to 
enhance the acceptance globally. 

Central to this Wallet platform will be our LALA Tokens that will allow seamless transfers 
and payments for various transactions and services. LALA Wallet also includes an API for 
third-party developers so they can interact with the Wallet, access balances, send 
transactions, invoices, and build other third-party applications on top. This will further 
enhance the LALA Wallet acceptability and usage. Third Party API business model will 
create more partners who can distribute LALA Services globally to strengthen this 
network.

The user can conveniently convert a wide range of Blockchain assets such as LALA, BTC, 
ETH and DASH by simply using his LALA Wallet which has an inbuilt exchange 
mechanism. If the user is not crypto savvy, they can also choose to store the currency in 
local Fiat and not use crypto at all, giving ultimate freedom to the user and truly bridging 
the old world to the new. 

The more you use your LALA Wallet, the more you are rewarded economically, not only 
by cheaper transactions, but also via LALA Tokens for activities like sending new 
remittances, topping up user’s balances, or cashing out other users balances at other 
ends, along with number of other LALA referral products and services as described 
below.

For mass acceptance of LALA Wallet, we have teamed up with various employers, 
NGO’s, contractors, support groups who bring these migrants to new countries. Along 
with their initial training, we will be conducting LALA Camps not only to educate them 
about new countries, but also adapt to their new LALA Wallet and how it can help them 
in a strange new country. Newer ways of interacting between themselves, support 
groups and any other issues they face can be all reached out via one single platform
- LALA Wallet 

Premise of your LALA Wallet starts by creating a single digital identity that you can carry 
globally – LALA ID. The team at LALA had a vision – to provide a digital identity to every 
person on the planet, starting with migrants and their unbanked families. We are also 
certain that if we have to create a truly global ecosystem, then we need a base 
identification system that is far superior than existing ID systems. That should be global 
in nature, but yet secure, private and available on demand.

This unbanked population is often excluded from basic rights like property ownership, 
banking accounts and any social protection just because they don’t have rights identity 
documents. Proof of identity is where it all starts.

LALA World and its partners have worked tirelessly to build a single global identity 
system which includes KYC/AML, biometrics, verification, digitisation of records, cards, 
national ID systems etc. This protects your security on blockchain and gives you freedom 
to conduct various financial services, all in one single Wallet. Primarily, your single LALA 
ID will be able to consolidate all physical and digital identity into a single secure & 
private ambient identity, pointing to a secure trusted dataset about the individual, 
thereby enabling easily individualised interactions in the physical and digital world 
across multiple vertical applications and compliment existing identity solutions.

Eventually LALA ID and its association with partners globally becomes your one single 
access point at various multiple applications and physical locations. The prototype and 
MVP are in place already and being tested at various locations.

“Digital Identity is a must for the millions of migrant labour 
population that visits through our platform every year and we 
are excited to take the first step with LALA for a truly global 

experience”

- Dato Ratha Vellai, Bestinet Sdn Bhd
  Malaysia



3. LALA TRANSFER

LALA’s management team and its partners are one of the most experienced crew who 
have run payment wallets, money exchanges, remittance and lending businesses for 
over 10 years in over 15 different counties. On top of solid experience and a great 
network, we have also built a great crypto offering – “LALA Transfer”,  for efficient, cheap-
er and faster remittance services globally. 

LALA Wallet, LALA ID and LALA Token are the central pieces to the LALA World ecosys-
tem. LALA Wallet allows seamless onboarding, LALA ID creates easy verification, AML / 
KYC and LALA Token provides the single mechanism for users, partners, money transfer 
agents / operators, to make quick and cheaper transfers within communities domestical-
ly as well as cross border.

ecosystem like money transfer operators (MTO), agents, franchises, LALA Force (own 
employees), contractors, vendors suppliers etc.

LALA World and its Partners facilitate deposits and withdrawals in fiat as well as other 
cryptocurrencies. Partners get their own dashboards including transactional analytics, 
customer historical information, KYC data and top up functionality which will facilitate the 
advent of LALA Franchise.

Migrant labour market, is our strength and a classic example of the suppressed and 
unbanked population. With about US$500 million flowing through South East Asia alone, 
every year, this population is exploited. With lack of banking facilities, working in a 
strange new country and culture, high exchange fees, number of intermediaries and 
brokers, no insurance, etc. they have been suppressed at every junction. 

At LALA World, our vision is to uplift these people. This is simply what is driving us today 
to achieve this global task of bridging the numerous problems they face with diversified 
solutions using technology and our networks.

A SELF SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM HAS TO BE CREATED. JUST TECHNOLOGY, 
SOFTWARE, FINANCIAL SERVICES CANNOT SERVE THIS PURPOSE, THERE HAS TO 

BE A NETWORK EFFECT.

LALA Transfer is all about changing that with very little fee on transfers. We are in 
discussion with various partners – governments, employment agencies, transfer agents, 
remittance services etc. to empower these migrants with LALA Wallets even before they 
board the plane. More detailed roadmap and partnerships are in following sections. We 
are in several discussions and are connected with multiple banks, for liquidity and low 
spreads.

As a part of LALA Transfer, our technology team is also working on an internal order book 
system on Blockchain that will allow us to match cross border remittances flowing from 
one country to another. A truly, secure, decentralised order matching where one could 
transfer money at domestic rates and at negligible costs. A true disruption focussing on 
not only the unbanked and migrant community but a service that all of us can use 
anytime, anywhere.

4. LALA LENDS

Peer to peer and micro-lending has been on a steep rise over the last five years. But if 
one looks around, its primarily the developed nations and companies who have blos-
somed into unicorns while the industry has promised to eliminate poverty, offering 
low-barrier loans to those historically unbanked financially. 

So-called “bottom-of-the-pyramid” solutions have led to strategies that many claim 
simply do not work and actually make poverty worse. This is where the Ecosystem 
approach comes handy. LALA team has extensive experience of mitigating this. LALA 
World supports individuals and small and medium sized businesses by offering them 

1. Micro loans, backed by LALA Token investors (and investors are rewarded). We are 
also working with some large funds & government partnerships to provide us 
underwriting capability to fund some loans

2. P2P loans inside the LALA Wallet from LALA Community – both in Fiat as well as 
Crypto

3. Community based projects (for e.g. small solar farm in a remote village) or small 
retailer loan based on their sales, trade data and invoice all embedded inside LALA ID 
and one Score – LALA Score.



Not only are the fees, much cheaper than traditional 
Wallets, but also payback rewards are massive, leading to 
almost nil fee when used globally. Customers will be 
allowed to top-up their LALA Card with ETH/BTC/LALA 
Tokens, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or via a 
pre-approved credit limit. Other third party partners 
like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay will 
be integrated in time to come.

5. LALA CARD

Within the LALA Wallet, user can choose to order a LALA Card, a virtual and/or physical 
debit (and in time to come credit card). As a security measure, we allow a user to lock and 
unlock his card through the LALA Wallet App. Furthermore, the user can also set limits for 
his family members and sync all the cards to the same Wallet. This makes our system 
more secure than traditional credit and debit card systems. 

Blockchain and LALA Tokens become very central to this as users can sync multiple 
cards to the same LALA Wallet, which can then be used as both Fiat and Crypto medium 
of exchange without incurring any high fees for such transfer at any time. Further, we will 
also be coming up with a loyalty mechanism tied to the LALA Card, so that more you use 
the wallet, the more you are rewarded as a LALA Token holder.

14Copyright 2017 @ LALA WORLD PTE LTD hello@lalaworld.io

P2P LENDING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

• LALA  ID generates LALA Score for users
• Working on decentralised credit scoring
• Powered by smart contracts & IPFS
• Peer to Peer lending 
• Peer to Peer Credit Vouching ( Like
  guarantees without guarantors)

INSTALLMENT BASED CRYPTO BUYING - EMI

• Your choice of Crypto asset to buy
• Buy as much you want against small margins
• Locked till all EMIs paid
• Competitive rates

MICRO LENDING FOR SMALL COMMUNITY PROJECTS

• Competitive interest rates
• No collateral 
• Immediate cash for predetermined time period

CRYPTO ASSET BACKED LOANS

• Get immediate Cash against your Crypto assets
• No need to sell them
• Competitive interest rates
• Prepayment penalties
• Get it back when you want

Most of the problems in micro 
lending arises due to mistrust and 
corruption. Also, to operate in 
these remote areas, one needs 
large overhead and operating 
costs, slow movement of funds due 
to centralisation.

By lowering the costs of cash 
transfer and doing business, 
blockchain could solve some of 
the main problems with 
microlending, allowing the new 
financial inclusion industry to 
blossom and start lifting people 
out of poverty at a world-changing 
rate.



7. OTHER LALA PRODUCTS

We are focussed and the vision of our management is very clear. Therefore we want to 
start with products and partnerships that we have built with over a decade of experience. 
We do not claim to know everything and clearly realise our strengths and weaknesses. 
Also, there are things that are best left to experts who are good at doing that. Therefore, 
we believe in stronger partnerships. We are good at creating this ecosystem, working 
hard, willing to learn but as we expand and grow, we need partners. Please feel free to 
reach out to us at hello@lalaworld.io if you would like to partner with us.

Above-mentioned products, in some shape or form are already being launched in 
various jurisdictions. MOU’s and definitive agreements are being signed across Asia, 
Africa and Middle East. Products like LALA Insurance, LALA Wealth, LALA ATM’s, LALA 
Force, LALA Franchise etc are all planned after 12 months. Right now we are on track to 
create a global Wallet for the unbanked. Roadmap and further plans are detailed in 
sections below. 

6. LALA KIT

LALA has a unique proposition, especially for the unbanked areas where we have 
already developed a MVP hardware Kit for greater penetration. This will also be sold at 
at local corner stores, shops and partner locations in the future.

Software cannot solve all problems and hardware has to be a part to create a truly 
globalised platform – Steve Jobs

LALA Kit is for everyone. A small business, grocery store, unbanked or a migrant labour. 
Buy LALA Kit from your nearest store or partner locations and be plugged in to the 
financial system instantaneously. No bank integrations, no filling of forms, no long 
queues, just activate your ID and sync with the phone inside, start using, get paid, 
receive money. LALA kit can also be pre-ordered online and delivered straight to you at 
a very affordable cost. A migrant labour, for example, can even get LALA Kit before he 
boards the plane from Bangladesh to Malaysia.

We are in discussion with several players to put this together. Initially we will have four 
items in there – 

15Copyright 2017 @ LALA WORLD PTE LTD hello@lalaworld.io

1. A cheap android phone currently prices at 
USD 50 (we are bringing this down via local 
subsidies and local partnerships, advertising 
revenue etc). The phone is ready and is being 
arranged to be shipped to Malaysia
2. Embedded in the Kit, will be a SIM card 
(already started in Malaysia & Bangladesh)
3. LALA Insurance on top of the existing “So 
called” insurance we will be providing a real 
insurance
4. Carrying unique QR codes. 
5. In future we will also bring in a pre-synced 
LALA Card, LALA PoS etc



To implement a seamless Blockchain technology, LALA team has been constantly 
sticking to some core principles and the real pain it is trying to solve for the unbanked. 
We have come to certain basic conclusions based on the geographies we intend to cover 
and the products we want to offer. There are some rudimentary issues in financial 
inclusion of these underprivileged populace that has to be solved by a mix of traditional 
cash, existing agent networks and advanced but seamless technology. 

Few key areas that we have considered while building the tech: 

1. Cash is still the dominant medium of exchange in these areas
2. Third party intermediaries and brokers are expensive
3. Peer to Peer is the road we want to eventually take for all LALA products
4. Smart contracts can be used to automate and create trust between participants
5. Exchange of value should be fast and efficient
6. There has to be a medium for store of value as well
7. Most of this population do not understand crypto, how it works and think it is agnostic

4. LALA TECHNOLOGY AND MVP

1. DESIGN AND APPROACH 

Most LALA Wallet users have smartphones but cannot afford expensive machines. 
Blockchain is maturing and reaching to a stage where there is currently a need for a 
single class, secure strong governance (decentralized) value exchange that uses 
maximum distributed computing so it is efficient and scales to millions of transactions per 
second when powered/powering billions of devices (single class of machines) while 
maximizing security and minimizing transaction fees (to almost zero). To achieve this, we 
are focussing on the following stack of technologies:

To achieve this, our base technology has to be very strong and we have studied various 
Blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Hyperledger and Bitshares, To make LALA World 
scalable we are looking at various off-chain solutions like raiden, Ethereum’s Lightning 
Network and Plasma, but they are all still in nascent stages and still testing.

We have tested and used Bitshares in the past. It’s a great technology pegged to all 180+ 
countries via USD, but uses Graphene and Graphene was hard to stabilise and continued 
freezing. For several other reasons we are staying clear for now.

At the moment a mix of Ethereum for ERC20 compliant LALA Token and Hyperledger 
fabric for transactional basis, is the best Blockchain solution available to build LALA 
World platform.

16Copyright 2017 @ LALA WORLD PTE LTD hello@lalaworld.io

Blockchain is a really good, resilient system. The interesting thing about bitcoin is 
since its inception, no one’s cracked it. Yet it’s completely in the open.

-Alex Batlin



Our MVP and PoC will be based on that primarily because Ethereum already has good 
adaptation in the market, including exchanges and other corporations, will be released 
before the ICO. Eventually we may opt for our own decentralised public Blockchain but 
for now we are building ERC20 compliant LALA Token and also looking at ERC223 on 
Ethereum main net. 

However, we constantly track evolution of other blockchain platforms and technologies, 
in case any other platform would provide higher smart contract flexibility or security for 
peer to peer financial smart contracts and scalability, such platform could also be used.

Cross-Border Payment & Transfer Wallet - LALA Transfer Cross-border payment wallet 
will utilize 2 Blockchains – Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Once listed, LALA Token 
exchange rate can be controlled by the market fundamentals of supply and demand but 
with this LALA Token can be easily implemented into 3rd party exchanges supporting this 
standard. 

KYC will be handled by LALA ID systems and KYC data will be stored in Hyperledger and 
decentralized storage. After KYC/AML is passed, users can transfer money from UAE to 
India or for example from Malaysia to Bangladesh for negligible fee. Currency control 
can be involved with API, to block any transaction in real time. Transactions will also be 
checked against sanction lists and blocked if required. 

Peer-2-Peer Internal Exchange - To minimize the exchange cost for the end users 
Peer-2-Peer Internal Exchange will be implemented. Users top up their accounts and put 
funds in a distributed escrow for secure trade orders. There will be BID and ASK order 
books for certain trade pairs. When a user creates an order, his order is added to order 
book on the blockchain and when another user who matches his trade order becomes 
the market taker. Small system transaction fee can be applied. Exchange processed will 
be handled by Blockchain and will be fully automated. 

Peer-2-Peer Lending – LALA Lends P2P lending business logic will be based on Ethere-
um Smart Contracts and Hyperledger Fabric Chaincodes. Users will have profiles and 
credit score in Hyperledger, more the user is involved the better credit score he gains. 
User’s credit history is transparent and can be shared with others upon his approval or 
can become public.

Lenders and borrowers can open new offers. The offer conditions are stored in a Smart 
Contract. It includes name, interest rate, etc. These offers will make lending / borrow 
order book – market makers. Lenders and borrowers can match the offers they like – 
market takers. The same offer can be matched by one or multiple user. Borrowers can be 
individuals or companies. Interest rate can be negotiable. 

All transactions can happen over LALA Tokens as central currency and create value for 
the network and the Token itself. Partnering with communities, governments, NGO’s and 
corporate for CSR activities enhances the acceptance of LALA Token further as a single 
Token to transact in the real world and not only just crypto exchanges. 

A separate technical paper and its details will be available on the LALA World website 
within this week.

5. LALA REFERRAL PROGRAM

A. Each Crowdsale participant (Pre-ICO and ICO) will be provided with a unique referral  
URL LALA.BUY.XXXXXX
B. A referrer will receive an additional amount of Tokens equal to 5% of the Tokens 
bought by all their referred buyers
C. This additional 5% is taken from the reserved 15% company Tokens as well as buy 
backs in the future.
D. When LALA launches its Wallet, these referral URLs get converted to Net Transaction  
Fee referrals where you will receive 5% of your referred users Net transaction fees every 
time they use their Wallet as long as both referral and referee hold LALA Tokens.  T h i s 
referral bonus will be allocated via smart contracts automatically on a monthly basis, 
moving on to weekly and then daily basis eventually.
E. Once you create your account or login, a referral link is generated and once you refer 
anyone, a list will generate under your referral link.
•  Referral link sent to friends via messengers
•  Referral link in your accounts on social media
•  Signatures on forums
•  Articles and blog reviews
•  Youtube videos about the project
•  Mentions of the project in blockchain social media groups

LALA TOKEN HOLDERS WILL HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES:

Eventually our goal is that everyone who participates for this noble cause, should be 
rewarded, short term investors, long term LALA holders and users of this platform. It’s a 
partnership, it’s an ecosystem and all this is not possible without everyone’s help and 
they all need to be rewarded for their time and effort.

A. Besides price appreciation, we have devised innovative schemes for our long-term 
investors & supporters to help this noble cause. For every LALA Token invested by these 
investors in community projects, LALA will invest an equivalent amount of tokens or 
community narrowing help for the poor and deserving. Investors can earn not only 
interest on the Tokens they already hold but also work towards a social cause
B. LALA long term investor can choose and vote for various community projects, 
including their own charities for helping this ecosystem as well as put forward their own 
communities that they want to support. These communities, micro lending projects and 
other local help can then be used by other investors and LALA team itself to successfully 
execute these projects

SHORT TERM INVESTORS

A. We are making every effort for short term investors to participate in this ICO and help 
this cause
B. There are referral programs, bounty campaigns, and we are working tirelessly to 
make sure that there is considerable price appreciation when LALA is listed in a few 
months
C. Referral programs ensure that you not only get additional LALA Tokens but you also 
get a share of the transactional revenue for every friend referred by you for life as long 
as you continue to hold LALA Tokens

REAL USERS

A. LALA Wallet has been devised in such a way that the users are rewarded at every 
step. For example updating KYC information, referring other users, community projects 
etc.
B. LALA and the team is for real development of the unbanked. Users, investors and 
other members who participate and help other users will be rewarded. Token holders will 
also be rewarded for acting as cash top up and cash out points via local GPS tracking
C. From time to time we will come up with various projects that LALA fund or community 
members nominate. Anyone participating on these projects will be rewarded in LALA 
Tokens

6. USE OF FUNDS

A detailed breakdown of Use of Funds is described here. Essentially the funds will be 
spent on:
A. Blockchain integration- with Ethereum network and research other upcoming 
protocols like Raiden υRaiden, Bitshares, Hyperledger, Qtum, OmiseGo etc to build most 
efficient, transparent and fast network. We believe in atomic cross-chain trading aka 
atomic swap, which is looking to revolutionize the way in which users transact with each 
other. It will greatly benefit our customers, will decrease fees, improve the speed of 
transactions and make our ecosystem more accessible for the underbanked. Our goal 
here is to have niche partners who excel in their field than build everything ourselves. We 
are creating an ecosystem, a network, and we should be building that with partners, not 
competition. This will consume a big chunk of funds including other technical 
advancements, partnerships, wallet development in every country, API integrations, AI 
and ML elements, support and related activities
B. Marketing- We intend to use the best marketing teams on a very cost-efficient budget. 
Prime aim for marketing is to be transparent and keep the LALA and Crypto community 
updated. This budget will also be used for local awareness and community activities in 
countries we go to. Again, the aim of marketing is to create awareness that you have 
LALA, when things are not gala
C. Business Development- As we expand products and geographies, newer teams and 
country managers would be hired. Out of the box thinkers with local grassroots 
connections will be preferred
D. LALA Fund- A separate fund will be put aside to invest in local communities and also 
in start-up projects where we strongly believe that the product can be a good fit for us in 
the future as well as the community
E. Joint Activities- with other companies, crypto communities, R&D, joint marketing etc. 
We will always be looking to integrate established and well researched teams and 
products rather than always building our own
F. Admin, HR, Legal, Finance-  With such a huge project, comes greater responsibility to 

be transparent. That is possible via 
highest standards of transparency 
not only for external investors but 
also our own teams. To that effect, 
there are some operational costs 
associated with accounting and 
administrative overheads to take 
care of the business processes 
needed for a growing international 
business
G. Legal- Not many ICO’s are 
stressing upon the importance of 
legal structures and legal teams. We 
are blessed to have put a strong 
legal team around us. We are, and 
will continue to be in direct contact 
with regulators



Data is becoming a new asset class- one that may trump previous
asset classes.

Its a long road, so we are just trying to stay focused and grounded and keep moving
forward. I’ll take it, though.

LALA’s vision is very simple – financially include the unbanked into the system who have 
been suppressed for the longest time. Access to basic financial services is a must in 
today’s day and age. Blockchain has come in as a blessing by creating a truly peer to 
peer ecosystem on a distributed network. 

We are aware that to change from the old Fiat system to this new decentralised 
ecosystem, will take time. That is why we are taking this journey to start with best of both 
worlds and eventually move to a truly decentralised network. 

Engaging everyone, especially the unbanked population in the electronic finance 
system via Blockchain will raise incomes of the poor and also improve health care and 
education systems. LALA is working with grassroot communities via NGO’s, Local JLG 
(Joint Liability Groups), Local governments and exploring numerous partnerships. We 
cannot do this alone. But we can give the tools and incentives to our partners to all come 
together, transact via one LALA Token, One LALA ID and bring financial services to your 
doorstep (aka Smartphone). 

LALA world is not merely another ICO focused on raising funds using BTC or Ether, but 
an entire ecosystem to engage the user via one currency LALA Token.

The vision was always to bring the unbanked together for a purpose and connect them 
via an ecosystem. LALA World is that Ethos
