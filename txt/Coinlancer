Overview Overview of the Freelance Market 

Demographics is one of the key reasons that has seen 

the freelance market grow by leaps and bounds over 

time. Multiple websites have been established linking 

the clients with potential freelancers besides 

facilitating the payment for the work done. 

Working online as a freelancer exposes one to various 

risks. Some of these risks include identity theft, lack of 

guarantee for hours worked pay, fake reviews, and so on.

Overview Overview of the Freelance Market 

Despite the demerits and risks in this industry, it is a 

rather lucrative one. One of the most popular 

platforms in the freelance workspace is Upwork. In 

the year 2014, the company recorded $941 million in 

freelancer earnings. In the same year, the entire 

industry generated an estimated $3.2 billion. 

Considering the rate of population growth and the 

gradual increase in internet literacy, the freelance 

industry is bound to grow further. In fact, it is 

estimated that the industry could grow to $10 billion 

annually in the next six years. This, therefore, means 

that there is an inherent need to undertake measures 

to curb some of the challenges faced by freelancers 

presently. Blockchain technology is an optimal 

solution in this regard.

Overview Problems with Current Freelance Sites 

$ 1 - $ 5 0 0 $ 5 0 1 - $ 9 , 9 9 9 $ 1 0 K  &  a b o v e

20% 10% 5%

Upwork is one of the renowned companies in the freelance space, and until recently, a freelancer 

loses about 10% of the amount paid by the client to the website. It requires the freelancer to pay the 

site 20% on the first $500 earned, 10% on $501-$9,999 and 5% on $10, 000 and above. The catch in 

this structure is that the fees are charged on a per-client basis. For instance, logo maker deals with 

several clients on a daily basis, which means they will be charged 20% on their earnings quite often. 

In other words, about one-fifth of their earnings will be lost to fees.

Overview Issues in the contemporary freelance 

Another issue faced in the freelance industry 

presently is the safety of the funds for the players in 

the transaction. This can be remedied by the use of 

multisignature escrow. This would ensure that funds 

for the client, freelancer and facilitator remain safe. 

Another issue faced in this market is particularly dear 

to the freelancers themselves, and that regards fees 

charged per job. Freelancers lose a good percentage 

of their earnings to the mediators. These mediators 

are technically existing freelance companies such as 

Upwork, freelance writing service and Fiverr among 

others. These mediators could potentially be 

eliminated through an established network that 

would act as a link between the freelancer and the 

client, demarcating any surcharges.

Overview

Besides above-discussed issues, the freelance market is faced with another major challenge 

regarding identity theft. Hiring people on the freelance websites exposes the participants to the risk 

of identity theft especially if their private user information is accessible. Freelancers stand at a greater 

risk of identity theft than the other participants in this arrangement. For instance, a malicious 

individual may steal John’s identity information. John is a qualified accountant with an incredible 

rating on the freelance website. The malicious individual then goes ahead to request for work 

charging $100 per hour. While the malicious person may benefit from this move, the integrity of the 

person whose identity is being wrongly used could be compromised.

Overview Issues in the contemporary freelance 

1. No Suspension of User Accounts

Freelancer accounts are often suspended on account 

of violating platform policies. The reasons for such 

suspensions have always been ambiguous and can 

range from sending too many proposals to 

prospective clients to inability to obtain projects due 

to poor matched skills. In most cases, reinstating of 

user accounts is a cumbersome process. Also, one of 

the main reasons freelancing projects fail is due to 

lack of support on such traditional platform. Contrary 

to traditional freelancing platforms, no unannounced 

suspensions occur on Coinlancer. The Freelancers 

Tribunal decides on accounts that are deemed 

violative and fairly decides on it.

2. Fair Dispute Settlements

The subjectivity of work on a freelancing platform 

often calls for discrepancies in opinions and 

settlements in disputes. A typical freelancing platform 

does not guarantee such settlements. The dispute 

settlements often involve surplus arbitration costs and 

unfavorable binding decisions, which may not be in 

the best interest of a freelancer. On Coinlancer, the 

discretion to decide on the arbitration of disputes lies 

with the Freelancers Tribunal. Every Freelancer within 

the tribunal is mandatorily a freelancer with a high-

profile ranking, preferably a 4 Star Applicant, eligible 

to decide on matters of arbitration.

3. Secure Payments

Delay or non-payments are problems typical to any 

freelancing platform. The clients and freelancers have 

very little control over payments. In most cases, after 

project submission, either the client doesn’t receive 

high-quality work by a freelancer or the freelancer 

does not get paid at all. Our Ethereum based 

platform uses the escrow payment system which 

holds the contract fees until the set obligations of the 

contract are met. On project completion, the funds 

are released, securing the interests of both the parties 

involved.

4. Less Transaction Fee- 3%

Traditional freelancing platforms require a freelancer 

to pay the site 20% on the first $500 earned, 10% on 

$501-$9,999 and 5% on $10, 000 and above. Since 

freelancers deal with clients on daily basis, 20% fee on 

each project will amount to huge earnings lost. 

Coinlancer confirms a fair control of fees. On any 

signed contract between a freelancer and a client, 

Coinlancer sets only 3% of the fees payable for a job 

offer.

Also, in most cases, the waiting period for the payouts 

to reflect in the freelancer’s bank account is often 

painstaking. It could be easier to incorporate 

payments to freelancers on the Ethereum network. 

This would not only make the payments prompt but 

would also reduce transaction charges incurred on 

bank transfers. Additionally, the security of the funds 

would be ensured through multisignature escrow.

By offering technological mobility, Coinlancer 

platform accepts 20+ cryptocurrencies.

Providing a flexibility to convert or transact in 

desirable cryptocurrencies across the platform. 

Coinlancer further elaborates on offering a greater 

number of services, including a wide range of 

cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform offers the 

ease of exchanges by providing links to external 

exchange platforms.

6. Identity Theft Elimination 

Our Ethereum based network allows for assigning 

usernames to individuals hence eliminating the need 

to tie them to their actual personal information. True 

personal information of the freelancers especially is 

only known by the ‘site administration,' which is 

technically the network, for the purpose of managing 

personal information and facilitating payouts to 

authentic freelancers.

7. Elimination of Fake Reviews 

Fake reviewing on most of the freelancing sites have been a 

popular earner with more and more individuals writing fake 

reviews by means of unique identity and email addresses. 

Thus, reviews on traditional platforms are rather deceptive. 

Coinlancer is an Ethereum platform that works on escrow 

system that constantly builds checks and balances in the 

system. 

It implements a customized software that detects 

suspicious reviews and removes those identified as fake. 

This is done by developing proprietary security algorithms 

for detection of scripts/bots that can be run on the 

platform.

It also enables consumers and businesses to flag reviews to 

the Coinlancer Team in case of violations of User Guidelines, 

in addition to termination of contracts on fraudulent 

occurrences.

8. Unbiased Dispute Resolution -Freelancers Tribunal

The subjectivity of work leaves it vulnerable and 

susceptible to discrepancies. Our Ethereum based 

platform confirms a fair control by means of a 

Freelancers Tribunal into our system. The tribunal 

involves freelancers with a high-profile ranking into 

the settlement of disputes. Every freelancer in the 

tribunal is entitled to cast a discerning vote that favors 

the rightful party and the consequences will be 

executed according to the Freelancers Tribunal. After 

the arbitration process, 3% of the funds in the Escrow 

will be held as the platform fees and the remaining 

funds are released from Escrow to the deserving 

counterparts of the dispute. The Freelancers Tribunal, 

however, does not receive any compensation for the 

votes cast.

Overview Mechanism 

The platform has a friendly and easy-to-use interface for clients 

and freelancers to help post their requirements with ease. Clients 

can list their jobs and freelancers can bid for them to get the 

desired jobs. 

To ensure the authenticity of the users, the platform will be 

performing identity verifications whenever necessary. The unique 

identities of clients and freelancers will be based on their 

addresses in the blockchain, making it difficult to forge. When a 

contract is awarded by the client, he needs to deposit platform 

fee which is paid in the Coinlancer token. The platform 

implements a 3% fee for employers and no fee for freelancers.

The platform will utilize smart contracts and Escrow mechanism 

to hold the fee and perform disbursement of the collected funds 

on obligations met. 

Freelancers Tribunal is created which decides on the disputes 

between clients and freelancers.

Overview Coinlancer Fee Structure 

Coinlancer offers a secure form of payment which 

protects interests of all the parties involved. Once a 

fee is agreed upon by a client and a freelancer, 

additional 3% platform fee is deposited by the client 

in our escrow system. The fee is released on successful 

completion of the project and 3% is held by the 

platform. 

In case of a dispute, the dispute is referred to the 

Freelancers Tribunal. 

The 3% platform fees will be paid in Coinlancer 

tokens.

Overview Coinlancer Token

Coinlancer is the native token of Coinlancer platform. 

This token is the primary mechanism by which 3% 

Escrow fees will be paid to the Coinlancer platform. 

There is an inherent utility of these tokens for anyone 

who wants to interact with users on the Coinlancer 

platform. As the freelancing platform becomes 

popular among the users, there will be a demand for 

more Coinlancer tokens which would increase its 

value for the existing token holders.

Overview Initial Coin Offering 

The platform will seek help from the community for 

ideas/projects. Community help will be rewarded with 

Bounty credits from 2% of reserves of the Coinlancer 

funds. Bounty credits are awarded in Coinlancer 

tokens created during the ICO launch. 

Tokens could later be exchanged for virtual currency.

The launch will essentially be a minimum viable 

product. However, many more adjustments will be 

made in terms of tech development along the way. 

Further tech developments will include third-party 

integrations, cloud support, infrastructure upgrades to 

support user growth and stability and constant UX 

upgrades. Entire operations for the future will be done 

using the same funds. We do not plan on raising 

additional funding moving forward thus the size of 

the ICO.

Overview Project Tokens

Tokens will be locked for the team.

We are fully confident in the complete sale out of the ICO. 

In case we are not able to do so the remaining tokens will 

be locked for a year, after 1 year we will be releasing the 

tokens to the public at the current market price to 

safeguard the interests to the existing token holders. 

As of now, majority of the funds will be stored in BTC.

Our plans are to establish Coinlancer among the 

top freelancing platforms with about 1.8M registered 

users in 3 years, accounting for a 15% Freelancing Market 

CAGR.

The tokens will be available on HitBTC and Changelly. 

Unfortunately, we are not able to speculate on the timeframe 

as this would depend on integration with their infrastructure.

We are well on track with the launch. The platform demo is

We plan on attracting 0.5%, 0.7% and 1.1% in the first 3 years 

respectively out of a $1.518 trillion market in Year 3 with 162 

million users (global digital freelance users).

The platform will have an exponentially growing user base 

meaning that the infrastructure will be constantly upgraded 

in terms of stability, security and speed. In addition, the 

Coinlancer team is extremely feedback driven meaning that 

new features will be adopted with market dynamics. Finally, 

blockchain technology is developing at an exponential speed 

and we cannot exclude new technology integration in the 

upcoming years.

Overview Future Work 

Our current focus is on creating an efficient 

freelancing platform. Once we are successful in this, 

we plan to venture into the broader online labor 

market of BPOs and KPOs. We believe that the 

coordination and incentivization needed for such 

ventures can be achieved in a more efficient way over 

blockchain and through an Ethereum based platform.

of a contractual relationship. Its sole purpose is to provide relevant and reasonable information to potential token holders in order for them to determine whether to undertake a thorough analysis of the company with the intent of purchasing CoinLancer(CL)

Tokens.

Nothing in this White Paper shall be deemed to constitute a prospectus of any sort or a solicitation for investment, nor does it in any way pertain to an offering or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction. This document is not composed in 
accordance with, and is not subject to, laws or regulations of any jurisdiction, which are designed to protect investors.

CoinLancer(CL) Token is a utility token. This product is not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument and has not been registered under the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state of the United States or the securities 

laws of any other country, including the securities laws of any jurisdiction in which a potential token holder is a resident.

CoinLancer(CL) Token cannot be used for any purposes other than as provided in the White Paper, including but not limited to, any investment, speculative or other financial purposes.

rights, other than those specifically described in the White Paper.

Certain statements, estimates and financial information contained in this White Paper constitute forward-looking statements or information. Such forward-looking statements or information involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which 

may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the estimates or the results implied or expressed in such forward-looking statements.

This English language White Paper is the primary official source of information about the CoinLancer(CL) Token. The information contained herein may from time to time be translated into other languages or used in the course of written or verbal 

communications with existing and prospective customers, partners etc. In the course of such translation or communication some of the information contained herein may be lost, corrupted, or misrepresented. The accuracy of such alternative communications 

cannot be guaranteed. In the event of any conflicts or inconsistencies between such translations and communications and this official English language White Paper, the provisions of this English language original document shall prevail.

Risk Factors

The purchase of any tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks described below. Before purchasing CoinLancer(CL) Tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in this 
White Paper, and, specifically, the following risk factors.

A. Dependence on computer infrastructure

PGEP Limited's dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware and the Internet implies that PGEP Limited can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of your CoinLancer(CL) Tokens. Despite PGEP 

Limited's implementation of all reasonable network security measures, its processing center servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions 
caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the use of the CoinLancer(CL) Tokens.

B. Smart contract limitations

Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputational and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by 

independent third party increases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as any form of warranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws, 
vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete loss of CoinLancer(CL) Tokens.



www.coinlancer.io

37 Legal Disclaimers

C. Regulatory risks

The Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations regarding Blockchain technology-based applications, and such 

regulations may conflict with the current CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract setup and CoinLancer(CL)  Token concept. This may result in substantial modifications of the CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract, including but not limited to its termination and the loss of

CoinLancer(CL) Tokens as well as a suspension or termination of all CoinLancer(CL) Token functions.

D. Taxes.

Token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions involving CoinLancer(CL) Tokens. It will be a sole responsibility of the token holders to comply with the tax laws of the relevant jurisdictions and pay all required taxes.

E. Force Majeure.

PGEP Limited’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be prevented by PGEP 

Limited and shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal 

governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond PGEP Limited's control, which were not in existence at the time of Token sale. If such circumstances occur prior to issuance of CoinLancer(CL) Tokens and PGEP Limited is unable to issue CoinLancer(CL) 

Tokens within months from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at the request of the CoinLancer(CL) Token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original form of payment to the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds
