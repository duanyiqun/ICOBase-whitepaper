MATRIX Technical Whitepaper 
 

“The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of  

consciousness into our awareness.” 

- Lao Tzu (604-531 BC) 

 

The invention of Bitcoin in 2008 symbolized the advent of cryptocurrency. The succeeding 

years witnessed a dramatic growing of the blockchain technology. The introduction of 

Ethereum opened the path for supporting complex business behaviors with cryptocurrencies. 

The overall momentum of development, however, is now facing a series of key challenges. 

These include: (1) slow transaction speed; (2) programming barrier of smart contracts; (3) lack 

of security in smart contracts; and (4) inflexibilities in managing and updating blockchains. 

 

Designed to be the new generation blockchain, MATRIX leverages the latest artificial 

intelligence technology to resolve the abovementioned challenges. The fusion of blockchain 

and AI technologies enables MATRIX to build a revolutionary cryptocurrency, which support 

significantly boosted transaction speed, superior accessibility to general users, enhanced 

security under malicious attacks, and highly flexible operations. 

 

1. Objectives of MATRIX 

The challenges facing today’s blockchains have to be resolved before the ideal of 

cryptocurrency can really become reality. We believe the artificial intelligence technology, 

which has received an unprecedented growth in the past decade, provides out-of-box 

solutions to address the challenges. MATRIX is designed to be an intelligent chain to unleash 

the potential power of the blockchain technology. In this section, we briefly review the 

objectives of MATRIX. 

 

1.1 Automatic generation of smart contracts 

Although smart contracts give blockchains the essential capability to handle scaled 

commercial behaviors, they need the users to be able to write programs in a given 

programming language. With MATRIX, no programing expertise is needed any more for 

designing smart contracts. The unique code generation technique of MATRIX allows 

automatic conversion of an abstract description of a smart contract into an executable 

program. Matrix only requires users to input the core elements (e.g., input, output, and 



transaction conditions) of a contract with a scripting language. Then a code generator based 

on a deep neural network is able to automatically convert the script into an equivalent 

program.  

 

1.2 Secured smart contracts 

Smart contract programs may call functions offered by the host system and/or third-party 

libraries. Also, programs running on different computers in a distributed framework do not 

provide any guarantee for execution time. Such openness and decentralization are the 

reflection of the essential spirit of blockchains, but give birth to various sources of security 

threats. In fact, the lack of security is plaguing the smart contracts. The MATRIX blockchain is 

equipped with a power AI security engine consisting of four major components, 1) a rule-

based semantic and syntactic analysis engine for smart contracts, 2) a formal verification 

toolkit to prove the security properties of smart contracts, 3) an AI-based detection engine 

for transaction model identification and security checking, and 4) a deep learning based 

platform for dynamic security verification and enhancement.  

 

1.3 High speed transactions 

Today all public chains are suffering from the problem of long transaction latency and low 

transaction throughput. Specifically, it takes over 30 minutes for Bitcoin to finish one 

transaction, while the transaction throughput of Ethereum is only 10 Transfer Per Second 

(TPS). In fact, a blockchain depends on a P2P network to validate transactions. Since a 

transaction needs to be broadcasted to all nodes in a network, the overall latency has to 

increase as long as more nodes are joining the network. MATRIX resolves the problem by 

dynamically selecting a delegation network in which all nodes are voted as delegates of 

others. All Proof-of-Work (PoW) processing is only allocated inside the delegation network, 

which only incurs a much smaller latency due to the smaller number of nodes. The selection 

process is random in the sense that a node is selected with a probability proportional to its 

Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The online version of MATRIX will support a throughput of 100,000 TPS. 

1.4 Flexible blockchain management  

MATRIX is designed to be a highly flexible blockchain. The flexibility is twofold. First, MATRIX 

offers access control and routing services so as to allow seamless integration private chains 

into a common public chain. Such a feature meets the requirements many industry and 

government players for authorization, while at the same time allows necessary information 

flow from a public chain to a private one and vice versa. Second, MATRIX uses a reinforcement 

learning framework to optimize its parameters (e.g., consensus mechanism, and transaction 



configuration) in an evolutionary manner. The optimization paradigm ensures dynamic 

updating of parameters for near-optimal performance without the risk of incurring hardfork. 

 

1.5 Value adding mining 

Perhaps the most criticized part of cryptocurrency is the “waste” of energy in the mining 

computations. Although it is essential to attach physical value to the cryptocurrency, the 

mining process does not make any sense out of the world of digital currency. The problem is 

even worse when now over 70% of the total computing power around of world is dedicated 

to mining Bitcoins and others. MATRIX introduces a new mining mechanism in which miners 

perform the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation, which is an essential tool for 

Bayesian reasoning. MCMC based Bayesian computing plays a fundamental role in numerous 

big data applications such as gene regulatory network, clinical diagnosis, video analytics, and 

structural modeling. As a result, a distributed network of MCMC computing nodes provide 

the power for solving real-world compute-intensive problems and thus build a bridge 

between the values in the physical and virtual worlds. 

2. A Brief Review of Technological Innovations in MATRIX 

The design of MATRIX depends on a large number of innovations in both AI and blockchain 

technologies. Table 1 summarizes the essential technologies of MATRIX. Thanks to these 

technologies, MATRIX distinguishes itself from its predecessors and initializes a new 

generation of blockchain.

3. Key Technologies of MATRIX 

AI plays an essential role in shaping MATRIX as an intelligent blockchain. Moreover, MATRIX 

is also the product of extensive optimization and extension of the blockchain technology. In 

this section, we review the key technology breakthroughs made by MATRIX. 

3.1 Hybrid PoS + PoW consensus based on stochastic network contraction  

The fundamental reason leading to the excessive transaction latency in today’s blockchains is 

the transmission overhead in a P2P network cannot scale with the number of nodes. The 

problem is inherent to the P2P based PoW consensus since every transaction is to be 

broadcast to the whole network. In fact, the latency has to worsen as long as the number of 

nodes increases. The recently proposed lightning network is devised to solve the above 

problem. What it does, however, is no more than creating a private channel for the payer, 

receiver and transferring nodes so that transaction can be completed once a consensus is 

reached. Such a process lacks a guarantee for the safety, especially when the channel is under 

malicious attacks, because it takes place off the blockchain. 

 

 

Figure 1. Random clustering based PoS + PoW consensus 

 

An effective out-of-box solution is to introduce a hierarchy into the P2P network so that the 

broadcast overhead can be contained. The key idea is to contract a network into smaller ones 

(i.e., create a hierarchy) and perform PoW computation in the contracted network with fewer

based on PoS and others

Delegation Network



nodes. The basic idea of MATRIX’s proprietary algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. The 

hierarchy is created with a distributed random clustering process without centralized control. 

When the clustering is completed, each node will have a delegate for itself.  The selected 

representatives constitute a new network, coined as delegation network, which has an 

adjustable number of nodes. Then the transaction is only broadcasted inside the delegation 

network. The PoW is allocated to the delegate nodes and one such node can further partition 

its work into smaller jobs and assign these jobs to the nodes voting for it. Note that the 

clustering is iteratively performed. The probability of a node to be selected as a delegate is 

proportional to its PoS and other factors. 

 

The distributed random clustering based consensus algorithm of MATRIX is designed as 

follows. 

1. A node determines whether it wants to be affiliated with another node based on PoS or 

other factors.  

2. The node sends a request to neighboring nodes asking them to join it as a cluster, 

together with a link list of proof certificates to sign on and a request for deposit. If other 

nodes agree to join the cluster, the certificate will be used for verification and they will 

be marked as “affiliation committed”. If they do not agree, they will be marked as 

“competitors” and will not receive information from this cluster.  

3. After becoming affiliated to a cluster, a node calculates the connectivity of neighboring 

nodes and elects a group of candidates according to certain rules. With a random 

method the best candidate will be elected and the respective message is distributed to 

other nodes. 

4. When one node has an enough number of affiliated nodes, it will be marked as “fully-

loaded”. Such nodes will compete to incorporate other clusters.  

5. Nodes will send invitations to neighboring nodes, asking the latter to join them. Through 

a multi-signature mechanism, they jointly generate a random seed, which can be used 

to initialize a Markov Chain procedure. An independent third party will judge who wins 

the competition by looking at the seed, public and private keys published by both 

parties, and the results of Markov computing. Both parties have to confirm the result 

and put a signature on the result, which is then published for book-keeping.  

6. Nodes will keep incorporating others until they become “fully-loaded”(meaning when 

the number of nodes reaches 255 or exceeds the total number of nodes N/128 in the 

previous round) or until all other nodes in its neighboring area are fully-loaded. It will 

then be marked “isolated”. 

7. When there are only “fully-loaded” and “isolated” nodes in the network, the next round 

of absorption starts. “Fully-loaded” will only absorb “isolated” nodes and vice versa. 



“Fully-loaded” nodes will become “Super” nodes (meaning they have more than 2^16 

nodes in the respective cluster, or more than the total number of nodes N/128 in the 

previous round), or “Isolated Super Absorbing Nodes (meaning the number of nodes 

falls below 32768, or there are less than 128 “fully-loaded” nodes left). 

8. When there are more than 255 “Super” nodes or “Isolated Super Absorbing” nodes, a 

next round of absorption begins and nodes will become core nodes, meaning they have 

more than 2^24 nodes in the respective cluster, or have more than the total number of 

nodes N/128 in the previous round. When the number of core nodes exceeds the total 

number of nodes N/128 in the previous round, the absorption process ends. 

 

The above procedure continues until there are less than 255 clusters. The super nodes of 

these clusters then become “delegate nodes”. 

 

3.2 Deep learning based code generation for smart contracts 

A significant advantage of MATRIX is that users of smart contracts no longer need to know 

how to do coding with a programming language. As a matter of fact, Matrix only requires a 

user to type in the purpose of the contract, i.e., input, output, and transaction conditions, as 

a script. Then a deep neural network based code generator will identify the basic transaction 

patterns and convert them into a program capturing the behavior of the target smart contract. 

In the future, we are going to use pure natural language as the input frontend. 

 

 

Figure 2. Deep learning based automatic generation of smart contract programs 

 

Recent development of the deep learning technology proves the feasibility of automatic code 

generation. First, the maturing of the convolutional neural network (CNN) enables extracting 

Script or natural 

language

high quality features from language and text. Second, the recurrent neural network (RNN) is 

mathematically proven to be a Turing complete computer that is able to generate any 

sequence. These deep neural networks offer the key techniques to analyze the purpose of a 

contract and generate a respective program. 

 

An illustration of the code generation process for smart contracts is shown in Figure 2. The 

script capturing the purpose of a contract is fed to a convolutional neural work, which is 

trained with a large number of labeled samples, to identify the underlying transaction patterns 

and data attributes. The discovered patterns are organized in a sequence and then given to 

a recurrent neural network. The RNN has its parameters trained with typical patterns of smart 

contracts. It transforms the input patterns into a program for the target program with the 

help of a code library containing codes for various design patterns of smart contracts. 

 

Besides offering dramatically enhanced accessibility, the code generation technology of 

MATRIX can be readily integrated with automatic security validation and enhancement 

techniques. In fact, the whole process can be made as a close-loop for iterative improvement. 

During the operation of MATRIX blockchain, the underlying models can be continuously 

updated for better code generation quality. 

3.3 AI-enabled security validation and enhancement 

MATRIX is designed to boost the security of blockchain to an unprecedented level. The overall 

security framework of MATRIX consists of four major components, 1) a rule-based semantic 

and syntactic analysis engine for smart contracts, 2) a formal verification toolkit to prove the 

security properties of smart contracts, 3) an AI-based detection engine for transaction model 

identification and security checking, and 4) a deep learning based platform for dynamic 

security verification and enhancement. Figure 3 depicts the framework. 



 

Figure 3. Deep learning based security validation and enhancement of smart contract 

programs 

 

3.3.1 Syntactic and semantic analysis  

Given a program of smart contract, MARTIX’s built-in compiler constructs a BNF-based AST 

as an internal representation. For smart contracts that have been compiled into Bytecode 

documents, MATRIX first disassembles the binary code and then produces a corresponding 

BNF. Based on a rule library, which is built with domain knowledge and historical experience, 

the compiler uses recursive descent parsing to check the AST for any security vulnerabilities. 

 

At the syntactic level, MARTIX’s compiler identifies the respective finite state machine and 

data flow graphs from the program. It then performs rule based checking and code revision. 

Typical examples include: (1) supplementing all conditional clauses to prevent execution 

problems due to incomplete conditions; (2) Analyzing all public members and  functions that 

are called to determine the level of exposure of contracts; and (3) checking whether 

transactions steps are complete to make sure that condition descriptions are complete. 

 

At the semantic level, MARTIX’s compiler provides contextual check to determine operations 

that do not satisfy rules or are not safe. Typical examples include: (1) checking objects and 

methods that have to be exposed to external environment to check their necessity and 

potential flaws; (2) validating whether contract branches or processing of ORACLE are 

completed and whether there are other abnormal operations when a contract is called; (3) 

checking the same condition in different options to avoid anomaly as a result of different call 

sequences.

3.3.2 Formal verification of smart contracts 

The above static syntactic and semantic analysis is able to identify logical flaws due to human 

factors. However, logical problems in runtime cannot be detected. For instance, a user may 

define contracting conditions when the target contract is under complex constraints. Also, 

security bugs can arise due to the fact that a contract is executed in a distributed environment 

and each node sees a unique execution sequence. As a result, the abnormal execution of a 

contract may leave a loophole for other programs to change its internal state. The Matrix 

blockchain is equipped with a formal verification framework validate the security properties 

of smart contracts. Based on a functional programming language, the framework integrates 

a SMT solver and has a multitude of models and tools. It has been used for verification of 

various software and encryption programs. 

 

 

Figure 4. Formal verification of smart contracts 

 

Figure 4 shows the formal verification flow for smart contracts. The verification tool-chain is 

capable of processing contracts at both source-code and bytecode level. The source code 

will be translated into an equivalent program in a functional programming language. The 

adoption of the functional programming model is to expose the hidden logic and ease the 

succeeding formal operations. The bytecode to be run on the MATRIX virtual machine is 

disassembled and transformed into an equivalent functional program. An equivalence 

checking and other consistency checking can be accomplished on the two functional 

programs. With the functional programs, a set of property checkers and theorem provers can 

be applied validate various security properties (e.g., whether the return value of send()

3.3.3 AI-based verification of smart contracts 

The abovementioned formal verification identified loopholes and bugs that can be captured 

with explicit formal rules. On the other hand, it is challenging to define a complete set of 

security properties that cover all possible situations. Accordingly, MATRIX has a deep learning 

based framework to discover the hidden intention of smart contracts and detect complex 

patterns of security vulnerabilities. 

 

MATRIX uses a convolutional neural network to extract textual features and detect interesting 

patterns. These patterns can be syntax or structure patterns (or a combination of the two).  

The former usually contains grammar and function features, while the latter structural 

features. The CNN is trained with Ethereum’s open-source smart contracts, which are 

manually labeled. 

 

One key characteristic of MATRIX is its use of AI to automatically identity program syntax to 

detect typical models and then automatically produce properties that satisfy security 

requirements. Given a program of smart contract, MATRIX’s AI engine will automatically 

detect similarity partial matching and complete matching to predict the behavior model of 

codes. Based on such models, the AI engine will produce a set of relevant constraints for in-

depth formal verification. 

3.3.4 Dynamic verification and security optimization based on deep neural 

network 

The security verification techniques covered in the previous three sub-sections are static ones. 

However, there are loopholes that can only be exposed during dynamic execution. 

Table 2 lists the Ethereum smart contracts’ vulnerabilities at three levels, namely, high-level 

programming language, bytecode, and blockchain. It can be seen that most problems in 

Table 2 only happen during dynamic execution in a distributed environment.

To address these issues, MATRIX resort two dynamic approaches, generative adversarial 

network (GAN) based security verification and distributed concurrence-based dynamic model 

verification. 

 



 

Figure 5. Deep learning based dynamic verification of smart contracts 

 

3.3.4.1 Generative adversarial network based security verification 

 

MATRIX adopts the recently developed generative adversarial network to accomplish 

dynamic security verification. As illustrated in Figure 5, the dynamic verification procedure can 

be coupled with the code generation framework as a closed loop. The GAN framework 

consists of two RNNs. One RNN is used to revise existing programs for smart contracts, while 

the other learns to generate hacker programs from random samples from a given probability 

distribution. After smart contract programs are generated, they will be deployed in the 

“sandbox simulation network (one that simulates a blockchain and where experiments can be 

conducted in a controlled manner)”, together with the corresponding hacker codes. The cost 

functions of these two networks are tied together so that the overall optimum is achieved 

when the whole system reaches a Nash-Equilibrium. At this point, the revised program for 

smart contracts has the highest level of security.  

 

3.3.4.2 Distributed concurrence-based dynamic model verification 

 

Besides the above general security verification and enhancement techniques, MATRIX also 

deploys customized tools for attacks as follows. 

 

(1) Contract sequence attack 

This attack takes advantage of the fact that the execution of smart contracts is asynchronous 

and subject to dynamic change. Even if a contract is statically secure, it is still prone to dynamic 

attacks, unless contract is designed as dynamically immutable. MATRIX uses machine learning 

techniques to defend contracts against such attacks. These techniques include relation

checking of the contract sets to identify relational contract transactions. MATRIX also provides 

an asynchronous simulator to help identify anomaly indicators of this type of attack. 

 

(2) Timestamp dependence attack 

The root cause of this type of attack is due to excessive discretion of miners. MATRIX uses AI 

to dynamically check timestamp dependence or random number dependence to avoid such 

behaviors.  

 

(3) Mishandling of exceptions and reentrancy attacks 

These attacks are in essence caused by anomalies triggered by the function calls of smart 

contracts. MATRIX uses a deep neural network to find the coding patterns leading to such 

vulnerabilities.  

3.4 Highly flexible blockchain architecture 

MATRIX is designed to enable an exceptional level of flexibility in blockchain management 

and operations. Figure 6 illustrates a reference architecture of MATRIX. As shown in the dotted 

box, a MATRIX blockchain consists of six types of networked nodes, standard MATRIX nodes, 

cloud access nodes, cloud storage nodes, MATRIX trustworthy gateway, storage nodes for 

external data sources, and AI service nodes. 

 

Figure 6. MATRIX system structure and deployment model 

 

Standard MATRIX nodes constitute one distributed collaborative control chain and at least 

one data chain. Each node should have the computing power to run a virtual machine.  The 

distributed collaborative control chain, abbreviated as control chain hereafter, is designed by

completely following the distributed and decentralized principle of blockchains.  

 

Cloud access nodes are devised to facilitate the access of mobile devices to MATRIX’s cloud 

service so that all devices connected to MATRIX have sufficient computing power.  

 

The block data of a MATRIX blockchain are copied in real time to the cloud storage nodes. 

Instead of serving for consensus, the cloud storage is designed to make it easier for users to 

view data offline. Users can obtain the transaction records for validation, data mining, and 

other purposes. 

 

MATRIX trustworthy gateway is the key interface to communicate with external data sources. 

This device will obtain all the external data sources requested by MATRIX and determine their 

credibility. When using these data, MATRIX nodes check the data consistency to determine 

the level of confidence of each data source and give a credit rating to each external node. 

MATRIX trustworthy gateways are also organized with a P2P topology.   

 

Storage nodes for external data sources from a pool for data obtained via MATRIX trustworthy 

gateways. The data have to pass an AI based validation procedure before being checked in. 

The pool will also store private data of users, but such data are encrypted to ensure that only 

authorized users have access. All data inside the pool can be verified by checking their 

signature without accessing their content to prove whether they have been tempered.  

 

AI service nodes serve two functions, supporting the optimization of the entire system and 

initiating various AI services on MATRIX. It can service external users by initiating MATRIX as 

a service provider and also arrange MATRIX nodes to offer services to internal users. The AI 

service nodes depend on affiliated hardware to provide computing power.  

3.4.1 Multi-chain structure of MATRIX 

Seeing the strong need to run public and private chains on the same platform, MATRIX is a 

blockchain support multi-chain integration. It allows the integration and interoperability of 

public chains being completely public and private chains being coordinated with a multitude 

of security access and control mechanisms. Figure 7 depicts a reference multi-chain platform 

enabled by MATRIX technologies. It consists of one control chain and multiple data chains. 

MATRIX’s support to public and private chains is mainly realized through a control chain to 

enable designated access control and security mechanisms. The control chain consists of 

control blocks for access control, data storage safety, and multi-user security. The way every 



data chain block is decoded and its parameter configuration are determined by the 

configuration of control blocks. There are also control blocks defining the configuration 

parameters of the P2P network. Thanks to the control chain, MATRIX adopts a three-tier 

security guarantee mechanism composed of block storage key, node security key and user 

security key. It uses group keys and node keys to encrypt transmission information and 

supports the distribution, management and security certification of security keys in the form 

of private chains. 

The idea of integrating multiple interoperable chains give MATRIX significantly greater 

freedom to support real-world scaled commercial applications. For instance, it is now feasible 

to have one data chain that supports Bitcoin and one Ethereum data chain. The two chains 

can exchange data and tokens through MATRIX’s secure smart contracts. 

 

 

Figure 7. MATRIX’s multi-chain structure  

3.3.2 Natural evolution of blockchain parameters 

A blockchain typically has a multitude of parameters such as block size, permission algorithm, 

consensus mechanisms, and mining algorithms. The configuration of these parameters has a 

significant impact on the overall performance of a blockchain. It is generally impossible to 

choose an optimal group of parameters for all situations. However, a dramatic change of 

these parameters incurs great risks for hardfork of cryptocurrencies. The introduction of the 

multi-chain integration complicates the problem because consensus mechanisms and other 

parameters of different chains can vary significantly.  



 

A reinforcement learning based parameter optimization engine is embedded into MATRIX 

blockchains. A so-called value network continuously learns the long-term rewards of fine-

tuning various parameters. After learning, the network can generate best parameter-tuning 

decision given the current structure and environment of a given blockchain. Figure 8 shows 

the natural evolution process of MATRIX. Since the MATRIX chain learns to optimize itself, he 

whole process is designated as natural evolution. 

 

 

Figure 8. Natural evolution of MATRIX parameters through reinforcement learning 

 

3.5 Proof-of-work with Markov Chain Monte Carlo computations 

Adopting a Hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism, MATRIX revolutionarily introduces a 

value-adding computation to replace the traditional Hash computations. The idea is to use 

the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation as Proof-of-Work. MCMC has wide 

applications in such scientific and engineering applications as personalized medicine, finance 

modeling, human cognition modeling, and social network analysis. As a result, the mining 

process can be unleashed for real-world applications and generate added value. In fact, we 

believe the MCMC based mining provides a stronger bridge between the assets in virtual and

MCMC constructs a Markov chain to draw samples from a target probabilistic density. As one 

of the most influential algorithms invented in the 20th century, it opens the path for enabling 

Bayesian reasoning with real-world data. MCMC is actually a family of sampling algorithms

and the upper half of Figure 9 lists the pseudo-code of a well-known derivative, the 

Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, to sample a posterior distribution (i.e., the distribution 

of a hypothesis given observed data). The MCMC algorithm has a group of essential features 

that make it appropriate to serve as a mining workload. First, it is compute intensive. The 

convergence of a complex distribution can take tens of millions of samples. The structural 

learning problem, which needs to sample a huge number of graph topologies, can take days 

to finish even on supercomputers. Second, the distribution of samples after convergence is 

unknown a priori. Such a feature makes it extremely hard to cheat by forging final results. 

Third, it is possible to evaluate the closeness to final convergence, although the final results 

are unknown. The lower half of Figure 9 illustrates one trajectory of sampling. The shaded 

rings in Figure 9 represent the target posterior distribution.

The MCMC computing pattern is not friendly to either CPU or GPU. In fact, MCMC involves 

various probabilistic computations such as random number generation and sampling 

probabilistic distributions. Such computations are not natively supported by current 

computers and thus incur significant overhead. In our previous work, we developed a 

Bayesian computing architecture for efficient MCMC computations. The overall hardware 

architecture is illustrated in Figure 10. It is organized as multiple stochastic multiprocessors to 

support multi-tasking. One or more stochastic multiprocessors can be allocated to execute a 

single task of Bayesian reasoning. A stochastic multiprocessor is equipped with a set of 8 

sampling units. Note that these sampling units can be invoked in a SIMD manner. A sampling 

unit is composed of a random number buffer and stochastic logic circuit with the purpose of

drawing random samples of a given set common distributions (e.g. uniform and binomial 

distributions). A commercial IP core is used to generate true random numbers. A 

programmable controller is designed to coordinate the parallel sampling according to the 

given MCMC program. The architecture is equipped with an on-chip exemplar memory, 

which is actually a hybrid computing/memory module to manipulate exemplar operations. 

Each stochastic multiprocessor also has a scratchpad memory for fast access of general-

purpose data. The above architecture serves as a prototype for mining hardware and can be 

implemented as a dedicated integrated circuit.

Age of Wonder 

2020.1: Mining & More Apps 

*Mining ICs 

*Computing/mining facility 

*Big data applications 

 

 

As shown in the roadmap above, the development of the MATRIX blockchain is organized 

into four stages. In the first stage, coined as the age of Genesis, we are going to build the 

infrastructure consisting of both a control chain and data chains. The blockchain infrastructure 

also supports the interoperability between a public chain and multiple private chains. In the 

second stage, the age of Speed, the focus is on developing a so-called light speed network. 

With the random hierarchy generation scheme, MATRIX will allow a transaction speed over 

100K transactions per second. The third stage, the age of Civilization, it will witness the rise of 

AI-enabled protection over blockchains. Besides offering ever stronger security protections, 

AI potentially allows the autonomous emergence of a constitution, which defines the rules of 

behaving ethically in the world of cryptocurrency but exhibits itself in a distributed manner. 

The objective of the final development stage is to build mining ICs, deploy mining facilities, 

and deliver big data applications. We designate this stage as the age of Wonder because for 

the first time the computing power of cryptocurrency can be leveraged by real-world data 

driven applications.  

 

 

 

5. Conclusion 

With the integration of cutting-edge technologies, MATRIX reflects the spirits of ancient 

Chinese sages. Lao Tzu, the great philosopher of China, once said, “the key to growth is the 

introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.” We introduce a new 

dimension, artificial intelligence, into the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. As the 

blockchain technology already connects the world as one, MATRIX’s AI-enabled intelligent 

blockchain will give us unparalleled capabilities of understanding the past and predicting the 

future.
