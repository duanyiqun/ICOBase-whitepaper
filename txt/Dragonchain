Background 
Dragonchain was originally developed at Disney’s Seattle office in 2015 and 2016 as the ​Disney               
Private Blockchain Platform​. Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented             1

publicly via the W3C Blockchain Community Group . The platform was later released as open              2

source​ ​software​ ​under​ ​the​ ​Apache​ ​2​ ​license​ ​in​ ​October​ ​of​ ​2016. 

Dragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications onto a blockchain and provides             
features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism,             
and​ ​multi-currency​ ​support.  

The Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain              
ownership​ ​and​ ​responsibility​ ​of​ ​the​ ​open​ ​source​ ​code.  

The Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless                 
architecture blockchain platform, and an incubator. The combination of serverless and blockchain            
technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is              
highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the                 
emerging​ ​wave​ ​of​ ​Blockchain​ ​solutions​ ​entering​ ​proof​ ​of​ ​concept​ ​stage​ ​across​ ​enterprises.  

Vision 
The Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of                
products and services to the community. Our vision supports areas of the market that are               
underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 2024 )              3

across an array of multi-billion dollar sectors such as Arts, Wine, Automotive, Legal, Digital              
Marketing, etc. These sectors and more will experience market disruption with blockchain

Problem 

Security​ ​on​ ​a​ ​Blockchain​ ​Platform 
Data exposure and security is a known issue to large institutions wanting to leverage blockchain               
technology, as they typically have very sensitive customer data that sometimes has regulatory             
or legal risks associated (e.g. banking, health, identity, etc.). The data exposure risk can be               
somewhat alleviated by either obfuscation or separation, however, in both cases, this requires             
extra design and development work up front, as well as reduces somewhat the utility of the                
blockchain​ ​system​ ​itself.  
 
A so far generally unrecognized risk in the use of blockchain technology is that associated with                
the public exposure of smart contract logic as necessary on most blockchain platforms. ​The              
smart contract is exposed and transparent which means that the team must implement very              
sensitive proprietary business logic in a separate system. Also, any obfuscated data may be              
unraveled​ ​by​ ​an​ ​interested​ ​viewer​ ​of​ ​transactions.  
 
Most important however is the combined risk of exposed data and business logic, as it is the                 
equivalent of placing your operational system, all of your data, and a bounty of funds in the                 
public domain. ​Unlike the well understood and successful open source model, where the             
discoverer of a flaw or vulnerability in utility software is incentivized to to fix the issue or notify                  
the community of its existence, in the case of a discovered vulnerability on a blockchain, the                
discoverer is actually incentivized to attack the smart contract and withdraw funds or valuable              
information.

Skill​ ​Set​ ​Challenge 
Leveraging blockchain technology for real business initiatives is expensive and very risky in an              
operational environment. This can be expected to result in low success rates as creation of               
software without blockchain technology is already fraught with difficulty and the addition of a              
relatively new technology such as blockchain with features such as cryptography, Proof of work,              
economics, currency modeling, game theory, and custom programming languages is sure to            
cause​ ​more​ ​trouble​ ​for​ ​a​ ​team​ ​as​ ​the​ ​overlap​ ​of​ ​these​ ​skills​ ​is​ ​particularly​ ​rare.  
 
Dragonchain solves this problem by allowing development and integration before the economic            
model is known. Monetization can be applied after a system is functioning and enough real data                
is​ ​available​ ​for​ ​analysis.

Solution​ ​&​ ​Business​ ​Focus 
When Dragonchain was originally launched, the team had several goals in mind based upon past               
experience​ ​developing​ ​blockchain​ ​solutions: 
 

● Protection​ ​of​ ​Business​ ​Data​ ​and​ ​Processes 
● Ease​ ​of​ ​Integration 
● Simplified​ ​Development 
● RESTful​ ​Interfaces 
● Simple​ ​Architecture 
● Short,​ ​Fixed​ ​Length​ ​Block​ ​Time 
● No​ ​Base​ ​Currency 
● Currency​ ​Agnostic​ ​with​ ​Multi-Currency​ ​Support 
● Interoperability​ ​with​ ​other​ ​Blockchains 
● Adoption​ ​of​ ​Standards 

The platform was designed for use in a wide variety of use cases and applications. It is particularly                  
useful in non-financial systems and in monetization and modeling of micro-economies for example to              
replace political economies within an organization with transparent rules to incentivize productive or             
otherwise​ ​valued​ ​behavior. 

Verification​ ​and​ ​Consensus 
In the open source Dragonchain Architecture document , we introduced the concept of "context             4

based verification" wherein Dragonchain adds another dimension to the common blockchain model.            
This new structure may be best thought of as a "blockchain of blockchains," where business nodes                
handle​ ​approval​ ​of​ ​transactions​ ​based​ ​upon​ ​local​ ​and​ ​sometimes​ ​proprietary​ ​business​ ​logic. 
 
The Dragonchain architecture provides ​five standardized levels of consensus to provide a            
spectrum​ ​of​ ​trust​ ​to​ ​consumers​ ​of​ ​data; 
 

1. Business​ ​(Approval)​ ​Verification 
2. Enterprise​ ​(Validation)​ ​Verification 
3. Network​ ​Diversity​ ​Verification 
4. External​ ​Partner​ ​(Notary)​ ​Verification 
5. Public​ ​Checkpoint​ ​Verification 

 

 

 

4​ ​Dragonchain​ ​Architecture​ ​-​ ​​https://dragonchain.github.io/architecture 

©2017​ ​Dragonchain​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Dragonchain​ ​Commercial​ ​Platform​ ​​ ​v6​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Page​ ​5​ ​of​ ​15 

https://dragonchain.github.io/architecture


As the verification level increases for a block, security increases, risk decreases, and measure of               
risk​ ​becomes​ ​possible.  

 

Level​ ​1​ ​Business​ ​Verification​ ​(Approval) 

Analogous to other blockchain systems, the business context provides localized approval of            
transactions and operates primarily on a trust basis. Although a proof algorithm can be applied, it is                 
not necessary as data approved at this level can be considered trusted by the team that owns the                  
data and any other team that decides to trust that data. This may best be viewed as web services on                    
a blockchain, where developers familiar with web services or similar traditional services development             
may​ ​productively​ ​leverage​ ​blockchain​ ​technology. 

Use of this model has been shown to improve the blockchain technology learning curve, as well as                 
lower the risk of decentralized system development. A team can build atop the Dragonchain system               
to integrate existing systems or add new capabilities without a full understanding of the economic               
modeling that may later become valuable. That is, many projects have seen value by starting with                
data transparency as a goal, followed by late binding to an economic model based upon historical                
evidence. 

Note that any data contained in the business defined payload of a transaction will not move                
across​ ​the​ ​network​ ​unless​ ​explicitly​ ​authorized​ ​by​ ​the​ ​owner​ ​of​ ​a​ ​node(s).  

©2017​ ​Dragonchain​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Dragonchain​ ​Commercial​ ​Platform​ ​​ ​v6​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Page​ ​6​ ​of​ ​15 



Level​ ​2​ ​Enterprise​ ​Verification​ ​(Validation) 
This context is defined Enterprise or network wide, and checks for block and individual              
transaction validity in form, signature, and required data elements. This can be considered as              
providing “Real-time Enterprise Governance” with rules defined at the Enterprise level for            
validation​ ​of​ ​all​ ​transactions​ ​regardless​ ​of​ ​the​ ​local​ ​business​ ​data. 

Level​ ​3​ ​Network​ ​Diversity​ ​Verification 
A Level 3 node will verify diversity of validation (Level 2) verifications. This verification context               
will ensure that validations of transactions are coming from a sufficiently diverse set of              
distributed sources. It also provides control and measurement of network effect and provides             
distributed security as an attacker would be required to attack multiple systems, businesses,             
and​ ​data​ ​centers​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​tamper​ ​with​ ​existing​ ​data. 

Level​ ​4​ ​External​ ​Partner​ ​Verification​ ​(Notary) 
A level 4 node will provide a notary functionality to the consensus process. Hosted by an                
external partner, a level 4 node cryptographically signs any level 3 verification records that it               
receives. This function allows the Level 4 node to act as an independent witness to level 3                 
verifications. 

Level​ ​5​ ​Public​ ​Verification​ ​(Public​ ​Checkpoint) 
A Level 5 node will provide a bridge to one or more public blockchains and allow clients to                  
interact​ ​with​ ​them​ ​(e.g.​ ​Bitcoin,​ ​Ethereum,​ ​Litecoin,​ ​etc.). 
 
With this, Dragonchain is able to provide a spectrum of trust for the consumer of blockchain                
data, where risk is accepted based upon a combination of real world contracts, reputation of               
nodes, and trustless system assertions. That is, one may trust one’s own data as valid, but                
require varying levels of consensus verification before accepting a partner or foreign node for              
use.​ ​The​ ​system​ ​will​ ​provide​ ​a​ ​human​ ​readable​ ​report​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​API​ ​access​ ​to​ ​this​ ​capability. 

Currency 
Dragonchain is intentionally “currency agnostic”. That is, the architecture defines the ability to             
create a blockchain without currency, or with one or more currencies in place. We've              
experimented​ ​with​ ​and​ ​expect​ ​to​ ​make​ ​available​ ​interesting​ ​currency​ ​features.  
 
See the Dragonchain open source architecture document for a full description of the currency              
architecture.

Serverless​ ​Deployment 
With the commercial launch of Dragonchain, Inc., we are leveraging the architecture of the              
Dragonchain platform to provide a serverless blockchain platform for business use.           
Dragonchain’s hybrid model allows a serverless approach, because the smart contracts are            
executed in a traditional model and on a trusted node. A team can productively use the talents                 
of a traditional software engineer, along with best practices devops to build a system, whilst               
leveraging​ ​the​ ​capabilities​ ​of​ ​blockchain​ ​technology. 
 
We will initially launch on Amazon AWS, with the entire system using AWS Lambda services,               
and with all user provisioned smart contracts deployed as Lambda services. Deployment in this              
manner will provide to the user the full scaling capacity of the AWS platform as well as all                  
available services. In the future, we expect to port the system for deployment to Google App                
Engine​ ​and​ ​Apache​ ​OpenWhisk​ ​for​ ​internal​ ​datacenter​ ​deployment.  

Availability​ ​of​ ​Established​ ​Languages 
With this arrangement, and due to the abstraction of trust provided by the Dragonchain              
architecture,​ ​the​ ​user​ ​has​ ​access​ ​to​ ​multiple​ ​full​ ​languages​ ​as​ ​supported​ ​by​ ​AWS : 5

● Python 
● Java 
● Node.js 
● C# 

 
These languages are consistently ranked in the top 10 for usage in the real world in such                 
surveys and studies as ​Redmonk Programming Language Ratings , ​Stack Overflow Developer           6

Survey , ​Github Language Trends , and ​PYPL Programming Language Popularity Index .          7 8 9

Availability of popular, established, and well understood languages for safe and secure use on a               
blockchain is a valuable capability in convenience and risk to the team and for adoption of the                 
Dragonchain platform. Millions of active developers currently code fluently in one or more of              
these languages and Dragonchain will provide an easy path for these developers toward the              
use​ ​of​ ​blockchain​ ​technology. 

Dragon​ ​Tokens 
Dragon tokens (AKA Dragons) represent a tokenized license for interaction with Dragonchain            
commercial platform services. The tokens will be issued and provided to the public via an open

Utility 
Dragons will be used by developers and organizations to interact with the Dragonchain             
commercial platform products and services (e.g. launch nodes, provision smart contracts,           
access incubator dashboard, etc.). As a tokenized license with value in utility service rights, the               
tokens will further allow individuals or organization to be rewarded in an open market for running                
public​ ​or​ ​private​ ​nodes​ ​for​ ​network​ ​consensus. 
 
Dragons will also be used to support projects in the DragonFund Incubator. They will provide               
early access to technology and data from the projects, as well as allow first access to purchase                 
tokens​ ​for​ ​use​ ​on​ ​the​ ​developed​ ​platforms. 
 
For the Dragonchain Foundation, the maintainer of the Dragonchain open source code,            
Dragons will be used to reward and incentivize developers contributing to the open source              
project and related projects. The tokens will be used to increase adoption in the developer               
community with rewards and training. Community members will be able to contribute on issues              
and designs, and reward active participation in the development of important functionality            
anywhere​ ​in​ ​the​ ​world.

Go​ ​To​ ​Market​ ​Strategy 
Dragonchain will penetrate the market through developer relations, corporate sales, and start-up            
services ranging from advisory to financing to development. To achieve this, the team and go to                
market protocols are assigned across a geographic emphasis with market managers across 3             
separate regions; Asia, USA, Europe. The role of the market manager is primarily concerned              
with​ ​localization​ ​issues​ ​and​ ​second​ ​the​ ​specific​ ​market​ ​tailored​ ​offerings.  
 
The nucleus of Dragonchain’s growth will stem from a blend of technology and incubation              
services. The technology model is similar to Amazon’s AWS model, and the incubation model is               
similar to Y-Combinator. Both highly prominent organizations that are deep rooted with            
community​ ​and​ ​market​ ​success.  

 

Professional​ ​Services 

Dragonchain​ ​will​ ​provide​ ​two​ ​levels​ ​of​ ​professional​ ​services,​ ​those​ ​offered​ ​by​ ​company​ ​staff​ ​and 

those​ ​provided​ ​by​ ​qualified​ ​preferred​ ​vendors.​ ​This​ ​will​ ​be​ ​for​ ​the​ ​purpose​ ​of​ ​helping​ ​new 

offerings​ ​into​ ​the​ ​world​ ​of​ ​blockchain​ ​and​ ​token​ ​offerings​ ​to​ ​successfully​ ​launch​ ​that​ ​allow​ ​for
