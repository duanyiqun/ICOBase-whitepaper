ABSTRACT
Diamonds have the potential to become the next asset class. This white paper addresses how CEDEX intends to 

bridge the gap between the current diamond ecosystem and the developing financial markets. After presenting the 

difficulties and obstacles unique to the diamond ecosystem, we will present four layers of developments and 

innovations marking CEDEX as the future global exchange for investment in diamonds. In contrast to other 

commodities, such as gold, it is difficult to achieve uniform pricing characteristics for diamonds since they are not 

fungible. One carat of diamonds is not equal to another carat due to many countless combinations of characteristics. 

Furthermore, the diamond market is missing liquidity. While one can buy diamonds at retail, it is a challenge to resell 

them at a reasonable market price. Since diamond exchanges operate on a business-to-business (B2B) basis, they 

are not relevant for traders and, in fact, there is no platform for reselling diamonds. This white paper outlines how we 

aim to bridge the gap between the current diamond ecosystem and the future diamond investment market through a 

tokenization process that will transform diamonds from a unique asset to a fungible asset with clearly defined values. 

In addition, we present a corresponding trading platform that will provide a two-sided market in which traders will be 

able to trade and liquidate their diamond holdings. We present and discuss the advantages of the CEDEX platform, 

the mechanisms to achieve fungibility for diamond trading, the process necessary to create diamond market value 

transparency and, finally, the blockchain-based CEDEX diamond-trading platform.

A person residing in Japan is not eligible for participating in the CEDEX Coin Token Offering unless otherwise stated 

in the Japanese Whitepaper separately prepared.

PROJECT ESSENTIALS

Creating a new asset class out of diamonds

First diamond exchange for retail clients

Market potential = US $350 billion

Financed by a publicly held company

1  INTRODUCTION

Diamonds are most commonly known as precious gemstones used in the jewelry industry. According to a recent 

report1, consumer demand for diamonds accounts for 95% while investment demand accounts for less than 5%. In 

2015, the value of the worldwide diamond jewelry market hit US $79 billion [13]. Moreover, Frost & Sullivan [19] 

predict a demand-supply shortfall of mined diamonds that increases every year, leading to a demand-supply gap of 

41 million carats by 2022 and 278 million carats in 2050 (approximately US $40 billion). As a result, diamond prices 

are likely to be affected over the coming decades, making them a potentially interesting investment asset.

Even though diamonds present an alternative investment, up until now, several issues have prevented their use as an 

investment vehicle. Bain & Company [26] identify three main constraints: First, it is difficult to achieve uniform pricing 

for diamonds in contrast to other commodities, such as gold, since diamonds are not fungible. As a result, one carat 

of diamonds is not equal to another carat. Generally, diamonds are priced based on clarity, color, cut and carat size, 

the “4Cs” of the diamond industry. However, they are also valued based on emotional factors [10][36]. Different 

combinations of the 4Cs result in countless characteristic combinations, making it difficult to establish a per-carat 

price. Second, there is a lack of pricing transparency in the diamond industry due to missing industry standards and 

oligopoly structures. Finally, the diamond market lacks liquidity in that diamonds are usually a one-sided market with 

limited to no ability to resell them at their real market price. Paradoxically, a surplus of liquidity also exists because the 

industry annually pushes diamonds worth approximately US $20 billion into the market. Even though diamond trading 

exchanges exist, they only service B2B transactions, making them irrelevant for individuals or traders.

Two main issues have to be solved in order to allow commodity asset tokenization of diamonds in particular: First, the 

creation of a process that transforms diamonds from a unique asset to a fungible asset with a transparent and clearly 

defined value. Second, the creation of a trading platform that provides a two-sided market in which traders can liquidate 

and invest in diamond holdings. This white paper addresses this gap by introducing CEDEX’s blockchain-based 

asset-class trading platform for diamonds, It answers the question of how to transform diamonds from a unique asset to 

a transparent, fungible asset. We also pose the following sub-questions: What data and market indicators must be 

compiled to create diamond market value transparency? How can a two-sided market for diamond trading be 

established? And, what are the mechanisms to achieve fungibility for diamond trading? 



The DEX comprises three elements (Fig.1). The first is the gem composite, expressed in percentage terms and 

representing a diamond’s gemological perfection. The second DEX element is the parallel composite indicating the 

rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category. The third DEX element is 

the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry.

Using the DEX, traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data, which has not been available so 

far. In so doing, traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money. 

An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www.cedex.com for  0.30-0.39, 0.50-0.59,0.70-0.79,1.00-1.19 Carat. 

To maximize accuracy, CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds. The accumulated data 

is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm. The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an 

accuracy rate of more than 99.5%.

3.2  DIAMOND TOKENIZATION

A private diamond holder or dealer wishing to liquidate his or her holdings will be able to use the simple CEDEX 

tokenization onboarding process to create a smart contract. This contract represents the financial offering, including the 

sale of a single diamond, a shared investment on a high value diamond or a diamond basket sold to multiple traders 

(Diamond ETF). Once the request is executed, the diamonds will be delivered to the custodian and validated against their 

GIA certificate. Following approval, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be created and sent to the owner’s digital wallet. The 

diamond will remain at the custodian for safe keeping and the Diamond-Smart Contract holder will have the option to either 

list the Diamond-Smart Contract on the CEDEX Exchange or to sell directly peer-to-peer

To ensure trust and reliability, the CEDEX Exchange will only allow its users to purchase GIA-certified diamonds. GIA 

certificates are issued following grading by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). 

2  CASE STUDY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
Section 2.1 describes the status quo of the current diamond trading market. In subsequent sections, we show the 

innovations the CEDEX platform will bring to the market. Section 2.2 gives additional background literature so readers 

who are new to this domain can become aware of necessary concepts, terms and frameworks.

2.1  STATUS QUO IN THE DIAMOND MARKET

At the moment, there are two main motivations for investing in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum or 

diamonds. First, traders purchase such commodities to maximize yields by generating above-market returns due to 

price appreciation. Second, hedge-oriented traders seek a stable store of value to preserve their capital or to lower 

the volatility of their overall portfolios, e.g. although polished diamonds generate less returns than other commodities, 

they are significantly more stable [26].

Interested traders who consider taking a position in diamonds have different options. They can either purchase 

individual stones or sealed boxes of stones, referred to as diamond bullions. Bullions are usually filled with small 

stones of a defined type and can range in price. Alternatively, private banks may offer their clients the opportunity to 

invest directly in physical diamonds, providing purchase services where diamonds are valuated and certified.

Traders may also gain exposure to prices of polished diamonds via asset management firms that buy and hold stores 

of physical diamonds. Those firms sell shares entitling holders to a pro-rata portion of the value of the diamond 

stores. The funds typically purchase polished colorless stones weighing one to five carats. Traders may alternatively 

buy shares of companies that operate in the diamond industry. However, the value of company shares does not 

necessarily correlate with the value of diamonds and depends on additional factors [26]. It is important to note that 

diamond exchanges only target B2B transactions and are not relevant for individual traders. Consequently, it is 

challenging for individuals to sell diamonds at their market price. This has led to the current system in which jewelry 

shops buy diamonds from individuals at a price point considerably below fair market value. 

2.2  RELATED PROJECTS USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project addresses the pricing issues and the need to unlock diamonds as an investment option using 

blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is best known for providing the foundation of the peer-to-peer (P2P) 

cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [29]. In recent years, the blockchain concept, also called the distributed 

ledger system, has spread in popularity. This has resulted in various blockchain-based applications such as in the 

finance sector [8][24][30], in prediction markets [20][35][37], as a platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications 

[9][32], in the legal industry [31] and so on.

CEDEX utilizes the Ethereum [39] blockchain for its solution. In addition to the underlying distributed ledger, Ethereum 

incorporates Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer to realize smart contract capabilities. 

Smart contracts are, “orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing 

means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties” [12]. The latter establish binding agreements and deploy 

applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities, e.g., a P2P-trading platform.

Several projects offer tokenization of asset classes, e.g., Goldmint [21], OneGram [22] and Xaurum [40], which 

represent gold-based cryptocurrency. Due to the fungible nature of gold, it is far easier to enable tokenization of 

metal-based asset classes. Carats.io2  and the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE) have established a diamond-backed 

cryptocurrency based on an index reflecting the activity within the Israeli diamond industry [18]. Alrosa3 is backing a 

Page 6

2 http://www.carats.io/

project similar to Carats.io together with an initial coin offering (ICO) called D1 Coin4. Everledger5 is also a 

diamond-focused and blockchain-based project that tracks defining characteristics, history and ownership of 

diamonds to create a permanent record on the blockchain.

3  THE CEDEX SOLUTION
The ultimate objective of the global website cedex.com is to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry 

and the more innovative financial markets. The platform envisions bringing together diamond holders who want to 

liquidate their holdings and traders looking to diversify or hedge their investment portfolio to include diamonds as an 

investment asset, and doing so in a secure and transparent way.

CEDEX is built on four pillars: The DEX proprietary technology, blockchain technology, diamond tokenization and the CEDEX Coin.

Section 3.1 presents the way the DEX establishes transparency and standardization in diamond trading. Section 3.2 

discusses the tokenization of diamonds. Section 3.3 maps the CEDEX solution in the domain of blockchain-based 

exchanges. Finally, Section 3.4 outlines the CEDEX Coin.

3.1  TRANSPARENCY AND STANDARDIZATION: THE DEX

The DEX, CEDEX’s proprietary machine-learning algorithm, addresses the most significant obstacles in transforming 

diamonds into an asset class, i.e. lack of transparency and coherence in diamond value appraisal. The DEX takes 

gemological data, diamond financial indice data and global inventory data into consideration. Utilizing the global diamond 

inventory data, the DEX quantifies diamond prices and ranks individual diamonds and their respective prices [38]. 

Briefly, machine learning allows software applications to accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly 

programmed. Machine-learning algorithms receive input data and apply statistical analysis for predicting an output 

value within acceptable ranges. 

3.3   BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project uses blockchain technology to tokenize diamonds. In the first phase, Diamond-Smart Contracts 

will be issued via a simple process initiated once a diamond holder lists a stone for trading. The simple interface will 

create a smart contract that represents the diamond's gemological data and additional information to allow the 

creation of a financial product that represents the underlying asset, i.e., diamonds. As the blockchain-based CEDEX 

ecosystem evolves, we anticipate the diamond ecosystem will adopt Diamond-Smart Contracts as the new means of 

trading diamonds.

Figure 3 shows the Blue Ocean vision of the diamond ecosystem. The finished polished diamond will be sent for 

registration to the gemological lab. After examining the diamond and issuing the grading report, the lab – using the 

CEDEX open platform – will list the diamond to create the Diamond-Smart Contract. The token includes the following 

information: GIA ID, register wallet, historical transactions and data necessary to create the fungibility mechanism. 

CEDEX offers a simple tokenization process to create a smart contract token (Diamond-Smart Contract) as described 

in 3.2

After the Diamond-Smart Contract creation, the diamond will be sent to a custodian. B2B digital diamond trading will 

commence until the stone reaches its final destination; either on the CEDEX Exchange as a financial asset or until it is 

purchased as merchandize by the end user. Once the diamond has been physically delivered to the end user, the 

Diamond-Smart Contract will be marked as delisted on the blockchain. 

Tokenizing diamonds is beneficial to the entire ecosystem in many ways:

No additional transportation and insurance costs will occur while stones are traded within the ecosystem.

All transactions using the CEDEX Coin will save fiat-currency transaction charges. 

The diamond origin and all transactions will be documented on the Diamond-Smart Contract.

The trades will be executed quickly, efficiently and P2P without any third-party involvement.

Open blockchain technology allows anyone to collect, aggregate and analyze data for their own purposes and 

for public use, thereby increasing transparency.

3.4   THE CEDEX COIN

The CEDEX Coin will be implemented as an ERC-20-compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain. Activity 

on cedex.com, and later on within the diamond ecosystem, will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin. This will 

make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy.

Traders who want to purchase diamonds and diamond derivatives via Diamond-Smart Contracts on the CEDEX 

platform will have to purchase CEDEX Coin to carry out their transactions.

Payment to and for all service providers, such as the gemological labs, custodian, insurance and transportation 

will only be possible using CEDEX Coin.

Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees. 

Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans.

Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform. The number of active 

users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets, either by expanding 

its own operation or via licensing software to local entities.

As Fig.4 shows, use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem. Dealers 

and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory 

and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs. 

 

4  A TWO-SIDED DIAMOND-TRADING MARKET
All Diamond-Smart Contracts, as well as their trades, will be stored on the blockchain, thereby providing a fully 

transparent registry of the underlying diamonds trading history. Diamond-Smart Contracts will be tradable on the 

CEDEX trading platform or on a P2P basis, allowing traders to easily participate in diamond investments. The novel 

result will be a decentralized and fungible asset-class trading platform that permits professional-level investments in 

diamonds without requiring any expertise in diamond trading.

To explain how CEDEX will establish a two-sided market for diamond trading, Section 4.1 specifies the mechanism 

for uploading diamonds to the platform for subsequent trading. Section 4.2 focuses on buying and selling individual 

diamonds. Finally, Section 4.3 describes the way CEDEX users may take possession of physical diamonds.

 

4.1  SUPPLY-SIDE: SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX

On the supply side, we have identified two main sources of supply:

a. Diamond Dealers –Post signing a strategic cooperation agreement with the diamond industry global leader IDEX 
online (see Partners section), CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers.

b. Private Diamond Holders – A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the 
inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly. A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or 

pawn shop usually receives a price 30-50% below fair market value. Such a spread between the buying and selling 

price is the result of the illiquid and currently non-transparent diamond market.

Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stones. In 2016 alone, approximately US $20 

billion was purchased at retail. We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of 

diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange. CEDEX use blockchain technology to tokenize all listed diamonds, including 

those from private owners, as illustrated in Fig 2. above. 

4.2   DEMAND-SIDE: INVESTING IN DIAMONDS

With the CEDEX platform, traders will be able to purchase a Diamond-Smart Contract (representing a diamond) 

using CEDEX Coin.

The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders: 

a. Commodity Traders – Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure 
to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to 

discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market.

b.  Cryptocurrency Holders – Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an 
opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets.

Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner, TechFinancials, Inc., CEDEX will gradually expand to 

more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios.

4.3  DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS

A trader who purchases a Diamond-Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond. In 

such cases, the delivery process will begin when the Diamond-Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process 

and the diamond is sent to the owner. Once the owner receives the diamond, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be 

marked as delisted by the smart contract.

5  CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS
CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial 

asset class using blockchain technology and asset tokenization. All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the 

relevant jurisdiction.

Section 5.1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform. Section 5.2 discusses the processing of 

short sales with categorized diamonds. Finally, Section 5.3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading.

5.1  CATEGORY TRADING

One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products. 

The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading. The 

methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics 

[15]. For each category, CEDEX defines a benchmark. Within each category, the diamonds will receive a deviation 

score from the category benchmark, which is encrypted in the Diamond-Smart Contract. The ability to assign a 

deviation to the Diamond-Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm. Once listed, a smart contract will 

calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate 

all Diamond-Smart Contracts in the same category, creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders.



Diamond Tokenization:

rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category. The third DEX element is 

the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry.

Using the DEX, traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data, which has not been available so 

far. In so doing, traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money. 

An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www.cedex.com for  0.30-0.39, 0.50-0.59,0.70-0.79,1.00-1.19 Carat. 

To maximize accuracy, CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds. The accumulated data 

is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm. The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an 

accuracy rate of more than 99.5%.

3.2  DIAMOND TOKENIZATION

3.3   BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project uses blockchain technology to tokenize diamonds. In the first phase, Diamond-Smart Contracts 

will be issued via a simple process initiated once a diamond holder lists a stone for trading. The simple interface will 

create a smart contract that represents the diamond's gemological data and additional information to allow the 

creation of a financial product that represents the underlying asset, i.e., diamonds. As the blockchain-based CEDEX 

ecosystem evolves, we anticipate the diamond ecosystem will adopt Diamond-Smart Contracts as the new means of 

trading diamonds.

Figure 3 shows the Blue Ocean vision of the diamond ecosystem. The finished polished diamond will be sent for 

registration to the gemological lab. After examining the diamond and issuing the grading report, the lab – using the 

CEDEX open platform – will list the diamond to create the Diamond-Smart Contract. The token includes the following 

information: GIA ID, register wallet, historical transactions and data necessary to create the fungibility mechanism. 

CEDEX offers a simple tokenization process to create a smart contract token (Diamond-Smart Contract) as described 

in 3.2

After the Diamond-Smart Contract creation, the diamond will be sent to a custodian. B2B digital diamond trading will 

commence until the stone reaches its final destination; either on the CEDEX Exchange as a financial asset or until it is 

purchased as merchandize by the end user. Once the diamond has been physically delivered to the end user, the 

Diamond-Smart Contract will be marked as delisted on the blockchain. 

Tokenizing diamonds is beneficial to the entire ecosystem in many ways:

No additional transportation and insurance costs will occur while stones are traded within the ecosystem.

All transactions using the CEDEX Coin will save fiat-currency transaction charges. 

The diamond origin and all transactions will be documented on the Diamond-Smart Contract.

The trades will be executed quickly, efficiently and P2P without any third-party involvement.

Open blockchain technology allows anyone to collect, aggregate and analyze data for their own purposes and 

for public use, thereby increasing transparency.

3.4   THE CEDEX COIN

The CEDEX Coin will be implemented as an ERC-20-compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain. Activity 

on cedex.com, and later on within the diamond ecosystem, will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin. This will 

make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy.

Traders who want to purchase diamonds and diamond derivatives via Diamond-Smart Contracts on the CEDEX 

platform will have to purchase CEDEX Coin to carry out their transactions.

Payment to and for all service providers, such as the gemological labs, custodian, insurance and transportation 

will only be possible using CEDEX Coin.

Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees. 

Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans.

Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform. The number of active 

users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets, either by expanding 

its own operation or via licensing software to local entities.

As Fig.4 shows, use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem. Dealers 

and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory 

and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs. 

 

4  A TWO-SIDED DIAMOND-TRADING MARKET
All Diamond-Smart Contracts, as well as their trades, will be stored on the blockchain, thereby providing a fully 

transparent registry of the underlying diamonds trading history. Diamond-Smart Contracts will be tradable on the 

CEDEX trading platform or on a P2P basis, allowing traders to easily participate in diamond investments. The novel 

result will be a decentralized and fungible asset-class trading platform that permits professional-level investments in 

diamonds without requiring any expertise in diamond trading.

To explain how CEDEX will establish a two-sided market for diamond trading, Section 4.1 specifies the mechanism 

for uploading diamonds to the platform for subsequent trading. Section 4.2 focuses on buying and selling individual 

diamonds. Finally, Section 4.3 describes the way CEDEX users may take possession of physical diamonds.

 

4.1  SUPPLY-SIDE: SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX

On the supply side, we have identified two main sources of supply:

a. Diamond Dealers –Post signing a strategic cooperation agreement with the diamond industry global leader IDEX 
online (see Partners section), CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers.

b. Private Diamond Holders – A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the 
inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly. A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or 

pawn shop usually receives a price 30-50% below fair market value. Such a spread between the buying and selling 

price is the result of the illiquid and currently non-transparent diamond market.

Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stones. In 2016 alone, approximately US $20 

billion was purchased at retail. We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of 

diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange. CEDEX use blockchain technology to tokenize all listed diamonds, including 

those from private owners, as illustrated in Fig 2. above. 

4.2   DEMAND-SIDE: INVESTING IN DIAMONDS

With the CEDEX platform, traders will be able to purchase a Diamond-Smart Contract (representing a diamond) 

using CEDEX Coin.

The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders: 

a. Commodity Traders – Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure 
to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to 

discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market.

b.  Cryptocurrency Holders – Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an 
opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets.

Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner, TechFinancials, Inc., CEDEX will gradually expand to 

more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios.

4.3  DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS

A trader who purchases a Diamond-Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond. In 

such cases, the delivery process will begin when the Diamond-Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process 

and the diamond is sent to the owner. Once the owner receives the diamond, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be 

marked as delisted by the smart contract.

5  CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS
CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial 

asset class using blockchain technology and asset tokenization. All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the 

relevant jurisdiction.

Section 5.1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform. Section 5.2 discusses the processing of 

short sales with categorized diamonds. Finally, Section 5.3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading.

5.1  CATEGORY TRADING

One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products. 

The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading. The 

methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics 

[15]. For each category, CEDEX defines a benchmark. Within each category, the diamonds will receive a deviation 

score from the category benchmark, which is encrypted in the Diamond-Smart Contract. The ability to assign a 

deviation to the Diamond-Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm. Once listed, a smart contract will 

calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate 

all Diamond-Smart Contracts in the same category, creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders.



The DEX comprises three elements (Fig.1). The first is the gem composite, expressed in percentage terms and 

representing a diamond’s gemological perfection. The second DEX element is the parallel composite indicating the 

rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category. The third DEX element is 

the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry.

Using the DEX, traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data, which has not been available so 

far. In so doing, traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money. 

An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www.cedex.com for  0.30-0.39, 0.50-0.59,0.70-0.79,1.00-1.19 Carat. 

To maximize accuracy, CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds. The accumulated data 

is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm. The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an 

accuracy rate of more than 99.5%.

3.2  DIAMOND TOKENIZATION

A private diamond holder or dealer wishing to liquidate his or her holdings will be able to use the simple CEDEX 

tokenization onboarding process to create a smart contract. This contract represents the financial offering, including the 

sale of a single diamond, a shared investment on a high value diamond or a diamond basket sold to multiple traders 

(Diamond ETF). Once the request is executed, the diamonds will be delivered to the custodian and validated against their 

GIA certificate. Following approval, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be created and sent to the owner’s digital wallet. The 

diamond will remain at the custodian for safe keeping and the Diamond-Smart Contract holder will have the option to either 

list the Diamond-Smart Contract on the CEDEX Exchange or to sell directly peer-to-peer

To ensure trust and reliability, the CEDEX Exchange will only allow its users to purchase GIA-certified diamonds. GIA 

certificates are issued following grading by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). 

2  CASE STUDY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
Section 2.1 describes the status quo of the current diamond trading market. In subsequent sections, we show the 

innovations the CEDEX platform will bring to the market. Section 2.2 gives additional background literature so readers 

who are new to this domain can become aware of necessary concepts, terms and frameworks.

2.1  STATUS QUO IN THE DIAMOND MARKET

At the moment, there are two main motivations for investing in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum or 

diamonds. First, traders purchase such commodities to maximize yields by generating above-market returns due to 

price appreciation. Second, hedge-oriented traders seek a stable store of value to preserve their capital or to lower 

the volatility of their overall portfolios, e.g. although polished diamonds generate less returns than other commodities, 

they are significantly more stable [26].

Interested traders who consider taking a position in diamonds have different options. They can either purchase 

individual stones or sealed boxes of stones, referred to as diamond bullions. Bullions are usually filled with small 

stones of a defined type and can range in price. Alternatively, private banks may offer their clients the opportunity to 

invest directly in physical diamonds, providing purchase services where diamonds are valuated and certified.

Traders may also gain exposure to prices of polished diamonds via asset management firms that buy and hold stores 

of physical diamonds. Those firms sell shares entitling holders to a pro-rata portion of the value of the diamond 

stores. The funds typically purchase polished colorless stones weighing one to five carats. Traders may alternatively 

buy shares of companies that operate in the diamond industry. However, the value of company shares does not 

necessarily correlate with the value of diamonds and depends on additional factors [26]. It is important to note that 

diamond exchanges only target B2B transactions and are not relevant for individual traders. Consequently, it is 

challenging for individuals to sell diamonds at their market price. This has led to the current system in which jewelry 

shops buy diamonds from individuals at a price point considerably below fair market value. 

2.2  RELATED PROJECTS USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project addresses the pricing issues and the need to unlock diamonds as an investment option using 

blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is best known for providing the foundation of the peer-to-peer (P2P) 

cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [29]. In recent years, the blockchain concept, also called the distributed 

ledger system, has spread in popularity. This has resulted in various blockchain-based applications such as in the 

finance sector [8][24][30], in prediction markets [20][35][37], as a platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications 

[9][32], in the legal industry [31] and so on.

CEDEX utilizes the Ethereum [39] blockchain for its solution. In addition to the underlying distributed ledger, Ethereum 

incorporates Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer to realize smart contract capabilities. 

Smart contracts are, “orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing 

means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties” [12]. The latter establish binding agreements and deploy 

applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities, e.g., a P2P-trading platform.

Several projects offer tokenization of asset classes, e.g., Goldmint [21], OneGram [22] and Xaurum [40], which 

represent gold-based cryptocurrency. Due to the fungible nature of gold, it is far easier to enable tokenization of 

metal-based asset classes. Carats.io2  and the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE) have established a diamond-backed 

cryptocurrency based on an index reflecting the activity within the Israeli diamond industry [18]. Alrosa3 is backing a

diamond-focused and blockchain-based project that tracks defining characteristics, history and ownership of 

diamonds to create a permanent record on the blockchain.

3  THE CEDEX SOLUTION
The ultimate objective of the global website cedex.com is to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry 

and the more innovative financial markets. The platform envisions bringing together diamond holders who want to 

liquidate their holdings and traders looking to diversify or hedge their investment portfolio to include diamonds as an 

investment asset, and doing so in a secure and transparent way.

CEDEX is built on four pillars: The DEX proprietary technology, blockchain technology, diamond tokenization and the CEDEX Coin.

Section 3.1 presents the way the DEX establishes transparency and standardization in diamond trading. Section 3.2 

discusses the tokenization of diamonds. Section 3.3 maps the CEDEX solution in the domain of blockchain-based 

exchanges. Finally, Section 3.4 outlines the CEDEX Coin.

3.1  TRANSPARENCY AND STANDARDIZATION: THE DEX

The DEX, CEDEX’s proprietary machine-learning algorithm, addresses the most significant obstacles in transforming 

diamonds into an asset class, i.e. lack of transparency and coherence in diamond value appraisal. The DEX takes 

gemological data, diamond financial indice data and global inventory data into consideration. Utilizing the global diamond 

inventory data, the DEX quantifies diamond prices and ranks individual diamonds and their respective prices [38]. 

Briefly, machine learning allows software applications to accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly 

programmed. Machine-learning algorithms receive input data and apply statistical analysis for predicting an output 

value within acceptable ranges.

on cedex.com, and later on within the diamond ecosystem, will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin. This will 

make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy.

Traders who want to purchase diamonds and diamond derivatives via Diamond-Smart Contracts on the CEDEX 

platform will have to purchase CEDEX Coin to carry out their transactions.

Payment to and for all service providers, such as the gemological labs, custodian, insurance and transportation 

will only be possible using CEDEX Coin.

Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees. 

Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans.

Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform. The number of active 

users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets, either by expanding 

its own operation or via licensing software to local entities.

As Fig.4 shows, use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem. Dealers 

and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory 

and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs. 

 

4  A TWO-SIDED DIAMOND-TRADING MARKET
All Diamond-Smart Contracts, as well as their trades, will be stored on the blockchain, thereby providing a fully 

transparent registry of the underlying diamonds trading history. Diamond-Smart Contracts will be tradable on the 

CEDEX trading platform or on a P2P basis, allowing traders to easily participate in diamond investments. The novel 

result will be a decentralized and fungible asset-class trading platform that permits professional-level investments in 

diamonds without requiring any expertise in diamond trading.

To explain how CEDEX will establish a two-sided market for diamond trading, Section 4.1 specifies the mechanism 

for uploading diamonds to the platform for subsequent trading. Section 4.2 focuses on buying and selling individual 

diamonds. Finally, Section 4.3 describes the way CEDEX users may take possession of physical diamonds.

 

4.1  SUPPLY-SIDE: SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX

On the supply side, we have identified two main sources of supply:

a. Diamond Dealers –Post signing a strategic cooperation agreement with the diamond industry global leader IDEX 
online (see Partners section), CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers.

b. Private Diamond Holders – A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the 
inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly. A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or 

pawn shop usually receives a price 30-50% below fair market value. Such a spread between the buying and selling 

price is the result of the illiquid and currently non-transparent diamond market.

Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stones. In 2016 alone, approximately US $20 

billion was purchased at retail. We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of 

diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange. CEDEX use blockchain technology to tokenize all listed diamonds, including 

those from private owners, as illustrated in Fig 2. above. 

4.2   DEMAND-SIDE: INVESTING IN DIAMONDS

With the CEDEX platform, traders will be able to purchase a Diamond-Smart Contract (representing a diamond) 

using CEDEX Coin.

The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders: 

a. Commodity Traders – Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure 
to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to 

discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market.

b.  Cryptocurrency Holders – Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an 
opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets.

Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner, TechFinancials, Inc., CEDEX will gradually expand to 

more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios.

4.3  DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS

A trader who purchases a Diamond-Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond. In 

such cases, the delivery process will begin when the Diamond-Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process 

and the diamond is sent to the owner. Once the owner receives the diamond, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be 

marked as delisted by the smart contract.

5  CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS
CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial 

asset class using blockchain technology and asset tokenization. All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the 

relevant jurisdiction.

Section 5.1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform. Section 5.2 discusses the processing of 

short sales with categorized diamonds. Finally, Section 5.3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading.

5.1  CATEGORY TRADING

One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products. 

The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading. The 

methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics 

[15]. For each category, CEDEX defines a benchmark. Within each category, the diamonds will receive a deviation 

score from the category benchmark, which is encrypted in the Diamond-Smart Contract. The ability to assign a 

deviation to the Diamond-Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm. Once listed, a smart contract will 

calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate 

all Diamond-Smart Contracts in the same category, creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders.

The DEX comprises three elements (Fig.1). The first is the gem composite, expressed in percentage terms and 

representing a diamond’s gemological perfection. The second DEX element is the parallel composite indicating the 

rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category. The third DEX element is 

the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry.

Using the DEX, traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data, which has not been available so 

far. In so doing, traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money. 

An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www.cedex.com for  0.30-0.39, 0.50-0.59,0.70-0.79,1.00-1.19 Carat. 

To maximize accuracy, CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds. The accumulated data 

is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm. The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an 

accuracy rate of more than 99.5%.

3.2  DIAMOND TOKENIZATION

A private diamond holder or dealer wishing to liquidate his or her holdings will be able to use the simple CEDEX 

tokenization onboarding process to create a smart contract. This contract represents the financial offering, including the 

sale of a single diamond, a shared investment on a high value diamond or a diamond basket sold to multiple traders 

(Diamond ETF). Once the request is executed, the diamonds will be delivered to the custodian and validated against their 

GIA certificate. Following approval, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be created and sent to the owner’s digital wallet. The 

diamond will remain at the custodian for safe keeping and the Diamond-Smart Contract holder will have the option to either 

list the Diamond-Smart Contract on the CEDEX Exchange or to sell directly peer-to-peer

To ensure trust and reliability, the CEDEX Exchange will only allow its users to purchase GIA-certified diamonds. GIA 

certificates are issued following grading by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). 

2  CASE STUDY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
Section 2.1 describes the status quo of the current diamond trading market. In subsequent sections, we show the 

innovations the CEDEX platform will bring to the market. Section 2.2 gives additional background literature so readers 

who are new to this domain can become aware of necessary concepts, terms and frameworks.

2.1  STATUS QUO IN THE DIAMOND MARKET

At the moment, there are two main motivations for investing in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum or 

diamonds. First, traders purchase such commodities to maximize yields by generating above-market returns due to 

price appreciation. Second, hedge-oriented traders seek a stable store of value to preserve their capital or to lower 

the volatility of their overall portfolios, e.g. although polished diamonds generate less returns than other commodities, 

they are significantly more stable [26].

Interested traders who consider taking a position in diamonds have different options. They can either purchase 

individual stones or sealed boxes of stones, referred to as diamond bullions. Bullions are usually filled with small 

stones of a defined type and can range in price. Alternatively, private banks may offer their clients the opportunity to 

invest directly in physical diamonds, providing purchase services where diamonds are valuated and certified.

Traders may also gain exposure to prices of polished diamonds via asset management firms that buy and hold stores 

of physical diamonds. Those firms sell shares entitling holders to a pro-rata portion of the value of the diamond 

stores. The funds typically purchase polished colorless stones weighing one to five carats. Traders may alternatively 

buy shares of companies that operate in the diamond industry. However, the value of company shares does not 

necessarily correlate with the value of diamonds and depends on additional factors [26]. It is important to note that 

diamond exchanges only target B2B transactions and are not relevant for individual traders. Consequently, it is 

challenging for individuals to sell diamonds at their market price. This has led to the current system in which jewelry 

shops buy diamonds from individuals at a price point considerably below fair market value. 

2.2  RELATED PROJECTS USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project addresses the pricing issues and the need to unlock diamonds as an investment option using 

blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is best known for providing the foundation of the peer-to-peer (P2P) 

cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [29]. In recent years, the blockchain concept, also called the distributed 

ledger system, has spread in popularity. This has resulted in various blockchain-based applications such as in the 

finance sector [8][24][30], in prediction markets [20][35][37], as a platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications 

[9][32], in the legal industry [31] and so on.

CEDEX utilizes the Ethereum [39] blockchain for its solution. In addition to the underlying distributed ledger, Ethereum 

incorporates Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer to realize smart contract capabilities. 

Smart contracts are, “orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing 

means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties” [12]. The latter establish binding agreements and deploy 

applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities, e.g., a P2P-trading platform.

Several projects offer tokenization of asset classes, e.g., Goldmint [21], OneGram [22] and Xaurum [40], which 

represent gold-based cryptocurrency. Due to the fungible nature of gold, it is far easier to enable tokenization of 

metal-based asset classes. Carats.io2  and the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE) have established a diamond-backed 

cryptocurrency based on an index reflecting the activity within the Israeli diamond industry [18]. Alrosa3 is backing a 

project similar to Carats.io together with an initial coin offering (ICO) called D1 Coin4. Everledger5 is also a 

diamond-focused and blockchain-based project that tracks defining characteristics, history and ownership of 

diamonds to create a permanent record on the blockchain.

3  THE CEDEX SOLUTION
The ultimate objective of the global website cedex.com is to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry 

and the more innovative financial markets. The platform envisions bringing together diamond holders who want to 

liquidate their holdings and traders looking to diversify or hedge their investment portfolio to include diamonds as an 

investment asset, and doing so in a secure and transparent way.

CEDEX is built on four pillars: The DEX proprietary technology, blockchain technology, diamond tokenization and the CEDEX Coin.

Section 3.1 presents the way the DEX establishes transparency and standardization in diamond trading. Section 3.2 

discusses the tokenization of diamonds. Section 3.3 maps the CEDEX solution in the domain of blockchain-based 

exchanges. Finally, Section 3.4 outlines the CEDEX Coin.

3.1  TRANSPARENCY AND STANDARDIZATION: THE DEX

The DEX, CEDEX’s proprietary machine-learning algorithm, addresses the most significant obstacles in transforming 

diamonds into an asset class, i.e. lack of transparency and coherence in diamond value appraisal. The DEX takes 

gemological data, diamond financial indice data and global inventory data into consideration. Utilizing the global diamond 

inventory data, the DEX quantifies diamond prices and ranks individual diamonds and their respective prices [38]. 

Briefly, machine learning allows software applications to accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly 

programmed. Machine-learning algorithms receive input data and apply statistical analysis for predicting an output 

value within acceptable ranges. 

3.3   BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project uses blockchain technology to tokenize diamonds. In the first phase, Diamond-Smart Contracts 

will be issued via a simple process initiated once a diamond holder lists a stone for trading. The simple interface will 

create a smart contract that represents the diamond's gemological data and additional information to allow the 

creation of a financial product that represents the underlying asset, i.e., diamonds. As the blockchain-based CEDEX 

ecosystem evolves, we anticipate the diamond ecosystem will adopt Diamond-Smart Contracts as the new means of 

trading diamonds.

Figure 3 shows the Blue Ocean vision of the diamond ecosystem. The finished polished diamond will be sent for 

registration to the gemological lab. After examining the diamond and issuing the grading report, the lab – using the 

CEDEX open platform – will list the diamond to create the Diamond-Smart Contract. The token includes the following 

information: GIA ID, register wallet, historical transactions and data necessary to create the fungibility mechanism. 

CEDEX offers a simple tokenization process to create a smart contract token (Diamond-Smart Contract) as described 

in 3.2

After the Diamond-Smart Contract creation, the diamond will be sent to a custodian. B2B digital diamond trading will 

commence until the stone reaches its final destination; either on the CEDEX Exchange as a financial asset or until it is 

purchased as merchandize by the end user. Once the diamond has been physically delivered to the end user, the 

Diamond-Smart Contract will be marked as delisted on the blockchain. 

Tokenizing diamonds is beneficial to the entire ecosystem in many ways:

No additional transportation and insurance costs will occur while stones are traded within the ecosystem.

All transactions using the CEDEX Coin will save fiat-currency transaction charges. 

The diamond origin and all transactions will be documented on the Diamond-Smart Contract.

The trades will be executed quickly, efficiently and P2P without any third-party involvement.

Open blockchain technology allows anyone to collect, aggregate and analyze data for their own purposes and 

for public use, thereby increasing transparency.

3.4   THE CEDEX COIN

The CEDEX Coin will be implemented as an ERC-20-compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain. Activity 

on cedex.com, and later on within the diamond ecosystem, will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin. This will 

make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy.

will only be possible using CEDEX Coin.

Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees. 

Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans.

Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform. The number of active 

users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets, either by expanding 

its own operation or via licensing software to local entities.

As Fig.4 shows, use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem. Dealers 

and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory 

and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs.

4.1  SUPPLY-SIDE: SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX

On the supply side, we have identified two main sources of supply:

online (see Partners section), CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers.

b. Private Diamond Holders – A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the 
inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly. A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or 

pawn shop usually receives a price 30-50% below fair market value. Such a spread between the buying and selling 

price is the result of the illiquid and currently non-transparent diamond market.

Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stones. In 2016 alone, approximately US $20 

billion was purchased at retail. We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of 

diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange. CEDEX use blockchain technology to tokenize all listed diamonds, including 

those from private owners, as illustrated in Fig 2. above. 

4.2   DEMAND-SIDE: INVESTING IN DIAMONDS

With the CEDEX platform, traders will be able to purchase a Diamond-Smart Contract (representing a diamond) 

using CEDEX Coin.

The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders: 

a. Commodity Traders – Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure 
to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to 

discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market.

b.  Cryptocurrency Holders – Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an 
opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets.

Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner, TechFinancials, Inc., CEDEX will gradually expand to 

more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios.

4.3  DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS

A trader who purchases a Diamond-Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond. In 

such cases, the delivery process will begin when the Diamond-Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process 

and the diamond is sent to the owner. Once the owner receives the diamond, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be 

marked as delisted by the smart contract.

5  CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS
CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial 

asset class using blockchain technology and asset tokenization. All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the 

relevant jurisdiction.

Section 5.1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform. Section 5.2 discusses the processing of 

short sales with categorized diamonds. Finally, Section 5.3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading.

5.1  CATEGORY TRADING

One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products. 

The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading. The 

methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics 

[15]. For each category, CEDEX defines a benchmark. Within each category, the diamonds will receive a deviation 

score from the category benchmark, which is encrypted in the Diamond-Smart Contract. The ability to assign a 

deviation to the Diamond-Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm. Once listed, a smart contract will 

calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate 

all Diamond-Smart Contracts in the same category, creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders.

The DEX comprises three elements (Fig.1). The first is the gem composite, expressed in percentage terms and 

representing a diamond’s gemological perfection. The second DEX element is the parallel composite indicating the 

rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category. The third DEX element is 

the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry.

Using the DEX, traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data, which has not been available so 

far. In so doing, traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money. 

An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www.cedex.com for  0.30-0.39, 0.50-0.59,0.70-0.79,1.00-1.19 Carat. 

To maximize accuracy, CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds. The accumulated data 

is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm. The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an 

accuracy rate of more than 99.5%.

3.2  DIAMOND TOKENIZATION

A private diamond holder or dealer wishing to liquidate his or her holdings will be able to use the simple CEDEX 

tokenization onboarding process to create a smart contract. This contract represents the financial offering, including the 

sale of a single diamond, a shared investment on a high value diamond or a diamond basket sold to multiple traders 

(Diamond ETF). Once the request is executed, the diamonds will be delivered to the custodian and validated against their 

GIA certificate. Following approval, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be created and sent to the owner’s digital wallet. The 

diamond will remain at the custodian for safe keeping and the Diamond-Smart Contract holder will have the option to either 

list the Diamond-Smart Contract on the CEDEX Exchange or to sell directly peer-to-peer

To ensure trust and reliability, the CEDEX Exchange will only allow its users to purchase GIA-certified diamonds. GIA 

certificates are issued following grading by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). 

2  CASE STUDY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
Section 2.1 describes the status quo of the current diamond trading market. In subsequent sections, we show the 

innovations the CEDEX platform will bring to the market. Section 2.2 gives additional background literature so readers 

who are new to this domain can become aware of necessary concepts, terms and frameworks.

2.1  STATUS QUO IN THE DIAMOND MARKET

At the moment, there are two main motivations for investing in precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum or 

diamonds. First, traders purchase such commodities to maximize yields by generating above-market returns due to 

price appreciation. Second, hedge-oriented traders seek a stable store of value to preserve their capital or to lower 

the volatility of their overall portfolios, e.g. although polished diamonds generate less returns than other commodities, 

they are significantly more stable [26].

Interested traders who consider taking a position in diamonds have different options. They can either purchase 

individual stones or sealed boxes of stones, referred to as diamond bullions. Bullions are usually filled with small 

stones of a defined type and can range in price. Alternatively, private banks may offer their clients the opportunity to 

invest directly in physical diamonds, providing purchase services where diamonds are valuated and certified.

Traders may also gain exposure to prices of polished diamonds via asset management firms that buy and hold stores 

of physical diamonds. Those firms sell shares entitling holders to a pro-rata portion of the value of the diamond 

stores. The funds typically purchase polished colorless stones weighing one to five carats. Traders may alternatively 

buy shares of companies that operate in the diamond industry. However, the value of company shares does not 

necessarily correlate with the value of diamonds and depends on additional factors [26]. It is important to note that 

diamond exchanges only target B2B transactions and are not relevant for individual traders. Consequently, it is 

challenging for individuals to sell diamonds at their market price. This has led to the current system in which jewelry 

shops buy diamonds from individuals at a price point considerably below fair market value. 

2.2  RELATED PROJECTS USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project addresses the pricing issues and the need to unlock diamonds as an investment option using 

blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is best known for providing the foundation of the peer-to-peer (P2P) 

cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [29]. In recent years, the blockchain concept, also called the distributed 

ledger system, has spread in popularity. This has resulted in various blockchain-based applications such as in the 

finance sector [8][24][30], in prediction markets [20][35][37], as a platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications 

[9][32], in the legal industry [31] and so on.

CEDEX utilizes the Ethereum [39] blockchain for its solution. In addition to the underlying distributed ledger, Ethereum 

incorporates Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer to realize smart contract capabilities. 

Smart contracts are, “orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing 

means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties” [12]. The latter establish binding agreements and deploy 

applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities, e.g., a P2P-trading platform.

Several projects offer tokenization of asset classes, e.g., Goldmint [21], OneGram [22] and Xaurum [40], which 

represent gold-based cryptocurrency. Due to the fungible nature of gold, it is far easier to enable tokenization of 

metal-based asset classes. Carats.io2  and the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE) have established a diamond-backed 

cryptocurrency based on an index reflecting the activity within the Israeli diamond industry [18]. Alrosa3 is backing a 

project similar to Carats.io together with an initial coin offering (ICO) called D1 Coin4. Everledger5 is also a 

diamond-focused and blockchain-based project that tracks defining characteristics, history and ownership of 

diamonds to create a permanent record on the blockchain.

3  THE CEDEX SOLUTION
The ultimate objective of the global website cedex.com is to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry 

and the more innovative financial markets. The platform envisions bringing together diamond holders who want to 

liquidate their holdings and traders looking to diversify or hedge their investment portfolio to include diamonds as an 

investment asset, and doing so in a secure and transparent way.

CEDEX is built on four pillars: The DEX proprietary technology, blockchain technology, diamond tokenization and the CEDEX Coin.

Section 3.1 presents the way the DEX establishes transparency and standardization in diamond trading. Section 3.2 

discusses the tokenization of diamonds. Section 3.3 maps the CEDEX solution in the domain of blockchain-based 

exchanges. Finally, Section 3.4 outlines the CEDEX Coin.

3.1  TRANSPARENCY AND STANDARDIZATION: THE DEX

The DEX, CEDEX’s proprietary machine-learning algorithm, addresses the most significant obstacles in transforming 

diamonds into an asset class, i.e. lack of transparency and coherence in diamond value appraisal. The DEX takes 

gemological data, diamond financial indice data and global inventory data into consideration. Utilizing the global diamond 

inventory data, the DEX quantifies diamond prices and ranks individual diamonds and their respective prices [38]. 

Briefly, machine learning allows software applications to accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly 

programmed. Machine-learning algorithms receive input data and apply statistical analysis for predicting an output 

value within acceptable ranges. 

3.3   BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

The CEDEX project uses blockchain technology to tokenize diamonds. In the first phase, Diamond-Smart Contracts 

will be issued via a simple process initiated once a diamond holder lists a stone for trading. The simple interface will 

create a smart contract that represents the diamond's gemological data and additional information to allow the 

creation of a financial product that represents the underlying asset, i.e., diamonds. As the blockchain-based CEDEX 

ecosystem evolves, we anticipate the diamond ecosystem will adopt Diamond-Smart Contracts as the new means of 

trading diamonds.

Figure 3 shows the Blue Ocean vision of the diamond ecosystem. The finished polished diamond will be sent for 

registration to the gemological lab. After examining the diamond and issuing the grading report, the lab – using the 

CEDEX open platform – will list the diamond to create the Diamond-Smart Contract. The token includes the following 

information: GIA ID, register wallet, historical transactions and data necessary to create the fungibility mechanism. 

CEDEX offers a simple tokenization process to create a smart contract token (Diamond-Smart Contract) as described 

in 3.2

After the Diamond-Smart Contract creation, the diamond will be sent to a custodian. B2B digital diamond trading will 

commence until the stone reaches its final destination; either on the CEDEX Exchange as a financial asset or until it is 

purchased as merchandize by the end user. Once the diamond has been physically delivered to the end user, the 

Diamond-Smart Contract will be marked as delisted on the blockchain. 

Tokenizing diamonds is beneficial to the entire ecosystem in many ways:

No additional transportation and insurance costs will occur while stones are traded within the ecosystem.

All transactions using the CEDEX Coin will save fiat-currency transaction charges. 

The diamond origin and all transactions will be documented on the Diamond-Smart Contract.

The trades will be executed quickly, efficiently and P2P without any third-party involvement.

Open blockchain technology allows anyone to collect, aggregate and analyze data for their own purposes and 

for public use, thereby increasing transparency.

3.4   THE CEDEX COIN

The CEDEX Coin will be implemented as an ERC-20-compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain. Activity 

on cedex.com, and later on within the diamond ecosystem, will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin. This will 

make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy.

Traders who want to purchase diamonds and diamond derivatives via Diamond-Smart Contracts on the CEDEX 

platform will have to purchase CEDEX Coin to carry out their transactions.

Payment to and for all service providers, such as the gemological labs, custodian, insurance and transportation 

will only be possible using CEDEX Coin.

Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees. 

Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans.

Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform. The number of active 

users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets, either by expanding 

its own operation or via licensing software to local entities.

As Fig.4 shows, use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem. Dealers 

and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory 

and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs. 

 

4  A TWO-SIDED DIAMOND-TRADING MARKET
All Diamond-Smart Contracts, as well as their trades, will be stored on the blockchain, thereby providing a fully 

transparent registry of the underlying diamonds trading history. Diamond-Smart Contracts will be tradable on the 

CEDEX trading platform or on a P2P basis, allowing traders to easily participate in diamond investments. The novel 

result will be a decentralized and fungible asset-class trading platform that permits professional-level investments in 

diamonds without requiring any expertise in diamond trading.

To explain how CEDEX will establish a two-sided market for diamond trading, Section 4.1 specifies the mechanism 

for uploading diamonds to the platform for subsequent trading. Section 4.2 focuses on buying and selling individual 

diamonds. Finally, Section 4.3 describes the way CEDEX users may take possession of physical diamonds.

 

4.1  SUPPLY-SIDE: SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX

On the supply side, we have identified two main sources of supply:

a. Diamond Dealers –Post signing a strategic cooperation agreement with the diamond industry global leader IDEX 
online (see Partners section), CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers.

b. Private Diamond Holders – A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the 
inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly. A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or 

pawn shop usually receives a price 30-50% below fair market value. Such a spread between the buying and selling 

price is the result of the illiquid and currently non-transparent diamond market.

Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stones. In 2016 alone, approximately US $20 

billion was purchased at retail. We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of 

diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange. CEDEX use blockchain technology to tokenize all listed diamonds, including 

those from private owners, as illustrated in Fig 2. above. 

4.2   DEMAND-SIDE: INVESTING IN DIAMONDS

With the CEDEX platform, traders will be able to purchase a Diamond-Smart Contract (representing a diamond) 

using CEDEX Coin.

The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders: 

a. Commodity Traders – Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure 
to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to 

discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market.

b.  Cryptocurrency Holders – Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an 
opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets.

Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner, TechFinancials, Inc., CEDEX will gradually expand to 

more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios.

4.3  DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS

A trader who purchases a Diamond-Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond. In 

such cases, the delivery process will begin when the Diamond-Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process 

and the diamond is sent to the owner. Once the owner receives the diamond, the Diamond-Smart Contract will be 

marked as delisted by the smart contract.

5  CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS
CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial 

asset class using blockchain technology and asset tokenization. All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the 

relevant jurisdiction.

Section 5.1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform. Section 5.2 discusses the processing of 

short sales with categorized diamonds. Finally, Section 5.3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading.

5.1  CATEGORY TRADING

One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products. 

The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading. The 

methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics 

[15]. For each category, CEDEX defines a benchmark. Within each category, the diamonds will receive a deviation 

score from the category benchmark, which is encrypted in the Diamond-Smart Contract. The ability to assign a 

deviation to the Diamond-Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm. Once listed, a smart contract will 

calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate 

all Diamond-Smart Contracts in the same category, creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders.

Figure 6 depicts an example where three diamond holders (shown on the left side) list diamonds that are all 1 carat in 

size, but have slightly deviating gem compositions. In the center of the figure is the CEDEX trading platform, which 

uses the DEX to calculate a 1-carat category that is a 100% gem composite. The result (on the right side) shows that 

the DEX calculations yield a clearly justified theoretical market price per diamond that is expressed in tradeable 

Diamond-Smart Contracts.

5.2   SHARED INVESTMENT

One of the most exciting and innovative trades the CEDEX platform will offer its users is the “Shared Investment” 

option. After uploading a diamond for trade, a diamond holder will have the option of selling the stone as a single 

Diamond-Smart Contract or as multiple Diamond-Smart Contracts. Choosing the multiple Diamond-Smart Contracts 

option will create multiple smart contracts that represent partial ownership of the backed diamond.

This function will, for the first time, allow retail clients to invest in high-valued diamonds that are usually a speculative 

and volatile segment of the diamond market.

5.3   SHORT SALE

Short selling is the well-established practice of selling securities without owning them. This strategy is motivated by 

the belief that the price of a security will drop, allowing it to be bought back a lower price to generate a profit. In such 

a case, traders earn the price difference of the security minus the borrowing cost. 

To open a short sale position [17] on the CEDEX Exchange, a trader will send a short sell order that will initiate a 

request to locate and borrow the relevant category. Once this order is approved and if the bid/ask prices match, the 

order will be executed. Short selling on CEDEX will use an automated feed from the Lending Company for the quick 

approval of the borrowing request.

When the short sale is executed, the Lending Company will lend the Diamond-Smart Contract to the short seller 

against collateral and borrowing fees. The collateral and lending fees will be calculated on a daily basis.

Fig. 7 shows the opening protocol of a CEDEX short sale position. To the left of the figure, the Lending Company 

lends a Diamond-Smart Contract to Trader A, who in return deposits collateral plus borrowing fees. Once the short 

seller ask price is matched by the buyer bid price, the trade will be executed.

Fig.8: To close the short position, Trader A buys the same Diamond-Smart Contract category on the CEDEX 

Exchange and returns it to the Lending Company. The Lending Company returns the collateral to trader A and the 

transaction is completed, leaving trader A with the trade margin minus the borrowing fees.

When the trader wants to close the short position, the same diamond category is bought back on the CEDEX 

Exchange and returned to the lender. The short seller retains the margin, less the borrowing cost paid to the lender. 

5.4  BASKET TRADING – DIAMOND ETFS

One of the main milestones representing the evolution of a financial asset is the creation of derivative products [16] 

that allow diversification and efficient market exposure. Briefly, a derivative product is a contract based on an 

underlying asset from which the former value is derived. Given the anticipated rapid demand for the new diamond 

asset class, the CEDEX platform is structured to develop financial instruments, such as exchange-traded fund (ETF) 

[33] trading. ETFs are traded comparably to stocks and traditionally held assets, e.g., commodities, bonds, stocks 

and so on.

Mapped onto the CEDEX system, a diamond holder will be able to upload a list of GIA certificates [34] to trade 

multiple diamonds as one basket. The CEDEX system creates multiple Diamond-Smart Contracts that each represent 

a partial ownership of the basket. This novel function is anticipated to evolve over time to complex financial products 

backed by diamonds, such as short ETFs, leveraged ETFs, single category ETF baskets, multi-category ETF baskets, 

rear and high value ETF baskets and more.

5.5  LOANS TO TRADERS

The diamonds held by the custodian on behalf of traders will be able to serve as collateral for providing loans.

Users will be able to get CEDEX Coin loans based on their portfolio liquidity. Interest will be set according to common 

interest rates. Such loans will be provided on selected Diamond-Smart Contracts (e.g. loans will not be given on 

shared investment Smart Contracts). Once a loan is granted, the Diamond-Smart Contracts that are set as collateral 

will be marked on the smart contract and could change ownership if the lender defaults.

Fig.8: Closing a short-sale position

6   THE CEDEX PLATFORM
The CEDEX platform will give traders a clear view of possible financial offerings without the need for extensive 

knowledge about diamonds. 

The trading platform screenshots below illustrate the methodology that will enable traders to choose either an investment 

range or an investment category. The DEX displays diamonds, listed in sequence by “best-value investment” from top to bottom.

The DEX rating range is represented numerically in values from 0.599 to 0.999 with the higher rating representing the most 

valuable investment (based on the DEX algorithm as described in Chapter 3.1).

In addition, the system will provide traders with financial and gemological data, allowing them to gauge the investment 

potential in parallel to the DEX recommendation.

Fig. 9: Screenshots of the CEDEX Exchange. The buyer will choose the desired investment category. The DEX, the proprietary CEDEX 

algorithm, sorts all diamonds in that category, displaying the best-value diamonds at the top (asking price vs. market price).

7  RAPID DEPLOYMENT – FEASIBILITY EVALUATION
We have performed a paper-based feasibility evaluation that considers existing blockchain projects to explore the 

degree of rapid CEDEX deployment. The suggestions in this section are tentative system candidates. Ultimately, the 

CEDEX ecosystem must satisfy functional and non-functional requirements derived from the system presentation in 

earlier sections. Section 8.1 briefly presents the requirements and Section 8.2 lists existing system candidates for rapid 

CEDEX deployment.

7.1   REQUIREMENT SETS

Functional requirements for the CEDEX system are as follows: 

Identification authentication of stakeholders is essential to ensure that only credibly credentialed interaction with the 

diamond-trading platform is possible. Smart-contracting capability is another functional requirement for diamond trading 

on the CEDEX platform. Evaluation functionality must guarantee that smart contracts are developed in a sound way and 

are executed as intended without flaws that would lead to unintended consequences, e.g., a wrongful diamond 

classification, loss of tokens and so on. Data-storage management is also essential for the CEDEX system. Mass data 

must be stored in a blockchain-based way and there should be an additional blockchain database with an elaborate 

manipulation-logics layer on top.

Non-functional requirements [2][23] for the CEDEX system are discernible during development versus runtime and we 

have chosen a suitable subset for both. Modifiability and integrality of the CEDEX system are non-discernible while 

security, interoperability, high automation, performance, usability and flexibility are discernible during runtime. Finally, we 

consider requirements of the CEDEX architecture that are beyond the scope of this paper and future work, namely 

scalability, applicability, completeness and feasibility.

Modifiability is non-discernible and means taking changes and adaptations to the diamond-trading context into 

account. These comprise regular updates and harmonization of composed blockchain systems, e.g., those resulting 

from regulatory changes.

Security refers to CEDEX’s ability to not allow unauthorized usage and denial-of-service attempts while allowing trusted 

users with good reputations. The sub-requirements of security [1] are system availability for authorized action, 

confidentiality and integrity. Confidentiality is the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Integrity is the 

absence of improper system alterations. A diligent security study is important to the CEDEX system implementation 

and our important future work.

High automation is assured if the CEDEX system considers the existing blockchain-based systems for an application 

implementation. Flexibility is given when the system is built to accommodate many diverse activities during runtime 

including the participation of diverse partners and the exchange of diverse data.

Usability of the CEDEX system [4] will be achieved by taking the following sub-requirements into account: User 

interface simplicity and error avoidance assumes anticipating and preventing common stakeholder-use errors during 

diamond trading; closely related error handling supports a user with error recovery and learnability infers users can 

quickly master CEDEX-based diamond trading.

7.2   EXISTING RAPID-DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS

To prevent us from "re-inventing the wheel," we performed a study about available systems for the rapid deployment of 

the CEDEX system. For identification, an existing blockchain-based system is Civic6, which currently only takes the 

email address and mobile phone number of users who wish to gain identified access into consideration. The 

advantage of Civic is that users retain ownership of their identity, which differs from alternative systems such as the 

Estonian e-residency7 identification. In the latter case, a government entity retains identification ownership and has the 

power of revocation, which is undesirable. While the newly established Civic identification is currently still limited, 

research shows [25] that authentication is essential to ensure an identified individual is who he or she claims to be. 

While the current version of Civic is limited so that authentication of identification is not assured, it is possible to 

combine Civic with other existing services such as Verify8, which automatically checks government-issued 

documents against database systems for identity authentication.

For smart contracting the current standard is Ethereum [39], despite acknowledged drawbacks. First, proof-of-work 

(PoW) transaction validation does not scale and thus, Ethereum is not feasible for most industry applications. 

Second, the Ethereum-affiliated Solidity smart-contract language cannot be formally verified [6] and was recently 

hacked9 because of security flaws. This resulted in a loss of approximately US $50 million10. More scalable is a 

smart-contract solution that uses proof-of-stake (PoS) [5] transaction validation and blockchain sharding [27]. For 

example, the smart-contract system Qtum [11] already uses PoS successfully in its application.

For smart-contract evaluation, several existing systems with minimal capabilities are available. For a limited set of 

insecure coding deficiencies, Securify11 formally verifies Ethereum smart contracts as a beta version. Securify provides 

an online verification example with checks for recursive calls, transaction recordings, unexpected Ether flows, insecure 

coding patterns and untrusted-input use in security operations. Other examples for projects under development are 

the Embark-framework12 and Populus13. Both appear immature for formal verification and evaluation.

The ongoing research topic of smart-contract evaluation is addressed in recent scientific publications. In [7], the 

authors explore the challenge of writing secure smart contracts. A problem is that programs and pseudonymous 

users call third-party program public methods with the consequence of insecurely combining trusted and untrusted 

programs. Translating the smart-contract code to the functional programming language F* is an option to allow for 

analyzing and verifying Solidity-code runtime safety and functional correctness. In [14], common smart-contract 

development pitfalls are checked based on a set of heuristics stemming from empiric observations of students. The 

occurrence of common development mistakes decreases by following best practices as the pitfall heuristics address 

the aspects of failures to use cryptography, misaligning incentives, errors in encoding the state machines and 

Ethereum-specific mistakes such as incentive or call-stack bugs.

For blockchain-based mass-data storage, the so-called Interplanetar File System14 (IPFS) [3] is an open-source, 

content-addressable, P2P, distributed hypermedia protocol. IPFS provides a highly performing block-storage model 

with hyperlink-addressable data sets. In IPFS, a single computer stores data subsets using content addressing with 

hash-linked lists distributed across several computers. Data is distributed in IPFS across several computers to develop 

distributed blockchain applications in addition to adding immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction.

For managing diamond-trading data, BigChainDB [28] is an existing suitable system candidate that is a decentralized 

blockchain database with blockchain characteristics for the creation and movement of digital assets, immutable 

trading-event tracing and decentralized control. Its complementary nature to other blockchain systems, such as IPFS, 

Ethereum or Qtum, is important for the CEDEX system.

8  MARKET TRENDS AND POTENTIAL
The current diamond B2B trade market is valued at approximately US $60 billion a year, with consumers purchasing 

merchandise worth US $20 billion annually. Only 5% of this US $20 billion market is purchased for investment purposes.

There are major global forces, mostly focused on the B2B or derivatives markets, seeking to introduce diamonds to 

the finance market. These include the Indian Commodity Exchange, RapX’s collaboration with Bloomberg and the 

Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange. The transformation from merchandise to financial asset class will increase 

investment volume substantially.

To evaluate the potential market size for investment diamonds, we have analyzed the gold market. This market has a 

turnover of US $700 billion, with gold and gold derivative investments totaling 80% approximately, or US $550 billion. 

The remaining 20% represents jewelry and industrial use. The current diamond market turnover is approximately 

US $90 billion with an investment value of only US $1 billion. By removing the market barriers described above, we 

believe diamonds will become the leading investment assets for traders seeking to hedge currency or get exposure 

to this alternative asset class. This shift could potentially increase the diamond investment market from US $1 billion 

to US $350 billion, assuming the relationship between investment turnover and jewelry and industrial use is similar to 

that of gold- 80% vs. 20%

must be stored in a blockchain-based way and there should be an additional blockchain database with an elaborate 

manipulation-logics layer on top.

Non-functional requirements [2][23] for the CEDEX system are discernible during development versus runtime and we 

have chosen a suitable subset for both. Modifiability and integrality of the CEDEX system are non-discernible while 

security, interoperability, high automation, performance, usability and flexibility are discernible during runtime. Finally, we 

consider requirements of the CEDEX architecture that are beyond the scope of this paper and future work, namely 

scalability, applicability, completeness and feasibility.

Modifiability is non-discernible and means taking changes and adaptations to the diamond-trading context into 

account. These comprise regular updates and harmonization of composed blockchain systems, e.g., those resulting 

from regulatory changes.

Security refers to CEDEX’s ability to not allow unauthorized usage and denial-of-service attempts while allowing trusted 

users with good reputations. The sub-requirements of security [1] are system availability for authorized action, 

confidentiality and integrity. Confidentiality is the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Integrity is the 

absence of improper system alterations. A diligent security study is important to the CEDEX system implementation 

and our important future work.

High automation is assured if the CEDEX system considers the existing blockchain-based systems for an application 

implementation. Flexibility is given when the system is built to accommodate many diverse activities during runtime 

including the participation of diverse partners and the exchange of diverse data.

Usability of the CEDEX system [4] will be achieved by taking the following sub-requirements into account: User 

interface simplicity and error avoidance assumes anticipating and preventing common stakeholder-use errors during 

diamond trading; closely related error handling supports a user with error recovery and learnability infers users can 

quickly master CEDEX-based diamond trading.

7.2   EXISTING RAPID-DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS

To prevent us from "re-inventing the wheel," we performed a study about available systems for the rapid deployment of 

the CEDEX system. For identification, an existing blockchain-based system is Civic6, which currently only takes the 

email address and mobile phone number of users who wish to gain identified access into consideration. The 

advantage of Civic is that users retain ownership of their identity, which differs from alternative systems such as the 

Estonian e-residency7 identification. In the latter case, a government entity retains identification ownership and has the 

Page 17

power of revocation, which is undesirable. While the newly established Civic identification is currently still limited, 

research shows [25] that authentication is essential to ensure an identified individual is who he or she claims to be. 

While the current version of Civic is limited so that authentication of identification is not assured, it is possible to 

combine Civic with other existing services such as Verify8, which automatically checks government-issued 

documents against database systems for identity authentication.

For smart contracting the current standard is Ethereum [39], despite acknowledged drawbacks. First, proof-of-work 

(PoW) transaction validation does not scale and thus, Ethereum is not feasible for most industry applications. 

Second, the Ethereum-affiliated Solidity smart-contract language cannot be formally verified [6] and was recently 

hacked9 because of security flaws. This resulted in a loss of approximately US $50 million10. More scalable is a 

smart-contract solution that uses proof-of-stake (PoS) [5] transaction validation and blockchain sharding [27]. For 

example, the smart-contract system Qtum [11] already uses PoS successfully in its application.

For smart-contract evaluation, several existing systems with minimal capabilities are available. For a limited set of 

insecure coding deficiencies, Securify11 formally verifies Ethereum smart contracts as a beta version. Securify provides 

an online verification example with checks for recursive calls, transaction recordings, unexpected Ether flows, insecure 

coding patterns and untrusted-input use in security operations. Other examples for projects under development are 

the Embark-framework12 and Populus13. Both appear immature for formal verification and evaluation.

The ongoing research topic of smart-contract evaluation is addressed in recent scientific publications. In [7], the 

authors explore the challenge of writing secure smart contracts. A problem is that programs and pseudonymous 

users call third-party program public methods with the consequence of insecurely combining trusted and untrusted 

programs. Translating the smart-contract code to the functional programming language F* is an option to allow for 

analyzing and verifying Solidity-code runtime safety and functional correctness. In [14], common smart-contract 

development pitfalls are checked based on a set of heuristics stemming from empiric observations of students. The 

occurrence of common development mistakes decreases by following best practices as the pitfall heuristics address 

the aspects of failures to use cryptography, misaligning incentives, errors in encoding the state machines and 

Ethereum-specific mistakes such as incentive or call-stack bugs.

For blockchain-based mass-data storage, the so-called Interplanetar File System14 (IPFS) [3] is an open-source, 

content-addressable, P2P, distributed hypermedia protocol. IPFS provides a highly performing block-storage model 

with hyperlink-addressable data sets. In IPFS, a single computer stores data subsets using content addressing with 

hash-linked lists distributed across several computers. Data is distributed in IPFS across several computers to develop 

distributed blockchain applications in addition to adding immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction.

For managing diamond-trading data, BigChainDB [28] is an existing suitable system candidate that is a decentralized 

blockchain database with blockchain characteristics for the creation and movement of digital assets, immutable 

trading-event tracing and decentralized control. Its complementary nature to other blockchain systems, such as IPFS, 

Ethereum or Qtum, is important for the CEDEX system.

8  MARKET TRENDS AND POTENTIAL
The current diamond B2B trade market is valued at approximately US $60 billion a year, with consumers purchasing 

merchandise worth US $20 billion annually. Only 5% of this US $20 billion market is purchased for investment purposes.

There are major global forces, mostly focused on the B2B or derivatives markets, seeking to introduce diamonds to 

the finance market. These include the Indian Commodity Exchange, RapX’s collaboration with Bloomberg and the 

Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange. The transformation from merchandise to financial asset class will increase 

investment volume substantially.

To evaluate the potential market size for investment diamonds, we have analyzed the gold market. This market has a 

turnover of US $700 billion, with gold and gold derivative investments totaling 80% approximately, or US $550 billion. 

The remaining 20% represents jewelry and industrial use. The current diamond market turnover is approximately 

US $90 billion with an investment value of only US $1 billion. By removing the market barriers described above, we 

believe diamonds will become the leading investment assets for traders seeking to hedge currency or get exposure 

to this alternative asset class. This shift could potentially increase the diamond investment market from US $1 billion 

to US $350 billion, assuming the relationship between investment turnover and jewelry and industrial use is similar to 

that of gold- 80% vs. 20%

7  RAPID DEPLOYMENT – FEASIBILITY EVALUATION
We have performed a paper-based feasibility evaluation that considers existing blockchain projects to explore the 

degree of rapid CEDEX deployment. The suggestions in this section are tentative system candidates. Ultimately, the 

CEDEX ecosystem must satisfy functional and non-functional requirements derived from the system presentation in 

earlier sections. Section 8.1 briefly presents the requirements and Section 8.2 lists existing system candidates for rapid 

CEDEX deployment.

7.1   REQUIREMENT SETS

Functional requirements for the CEDEX system are as follows: 

Identification authentication of stakeholders is essential to ensure that only credibly credentialed interaction with the 

diamond-trading platform is possible. Smart-contracting capability is another functional requirement for diamond trading 

on the CEDEX platform. Evaluation functionality must guarantee that smart contracts are developed in a sound way and 

are executed as intended without flaws that would lead to unintended consequences, e.g., a wrongful diamond 

classification, loss of tokens and so on. Data-storage management is also essential for the CEDEX system. Mass data 

must be stored in a blockchain-based way and there should be an additional blockchain database with an elaborate 

manipulation-logics layer on top.

Non-functional requirements [2][23] for the CEDEX system are discernible during development versus runtime and we 

have chosen a suitable subset for both. Modifiability and integrality of the CEDEX system are non-discernible while 

security, interoperability, high automation, performance, usability and flexibility are discernible during runtime. Finally, we 

consider requirements of the CEDEX architecture that are beyond the scope of this paper and future work, namely 

scalability, applicability, completeness and feasibility.

CONCLUSION

We have presented the CEDEX trading platform, which will turn diamonds into a tradable asset class. This paper 

explains the status quo in which the main problem hindering diamonds as a tradeable asset class is the very 

characteristic that the diamond industry promotes – each stone is unique. Consequently, there is a lack of 

transparency and liquidity, on the one hand, as diamonds change ownership via private transactions. On the other 

hand, there is an untapped investment market that we estimate at US $350 billion. Once CEDEX is launched, this 

investment market will start growing rapidly.

We have discussed our long-term vision of a diamond ecosystem based on blockchain technology and shown 

examples of other projects that are also based on tokenizing diamonds and in which all means of payments are digital. 

The market indicators for creating diamond market value transparency and coherence are established by the DEX, the 

CEDEX machine-learning algorithm that takes several factors into account. 

These factors include diamond financial and global inventory data, diamond prices and their individual rankings. 

Currently, the DEX is available for 0.3-, 0.5- and 1-carat round diamonds.

A considerable challenge has been to establish fungibility for diamonds to allow uniform trading. The CEDEX platform 

will solve this problem by applying the DEX algorithm and creating a smart-contract that represents a gemologically 

validated asset. Consequently, it is possible to apply innovative trading mechanisms employing blockchain-based 

tokens, such as category trading, short selling or ETF trading, to the diamond industry. We stress that these 

mechanisms are not a complete set. In the future, more diamond-trading mechanisms will be developed with 

blockchain-based tokenization of diamonds being the technological enabler.

The Diamond-Smart Contracts will be transparently registered on the blockchain to achieve full diamond-trading 

traceability. This will allow Diamond-Smart Contracts, representing fungible diamonds, to be traded on the CEDEX 

platform or P2P by professional traders in a decentralized way. Consequently, we will enable single-diamond trading, 

uploading diamonds for sale and also taking physical delivery by a trader in which all related events are stored on the 

blockchain. The result will be the establishment of a two-sided market for diamond trading.

While the deployment feasibility of the CEDEX system is positive, limitations of this paper pertain to the CEDEX 

platform being a decentralized and distributed diamond-trading platform with complex business semantics flowing 

across system components that must be cross-component dependable and free of concurrency conflicts.

APPENDIX A - CEDEX COIN TOKEN OFFERING

The pre-sale offering will be conducted over a maximum period of 10 days, or, or until the pre-sale cap is reached. The 

pre-sale will begin on March 16th, 2018 at 10:00 GMT. The main-sale start date will be dictated by the completion of the 

pre-sale. The main-sale will commence at 10:00 GMT on the day following the close of the pre-sale and will last 28 days or 

until the maximum cap is reached.

The CEDEX project will issue a maximum of 100,000,000 CEDEX Coins.

The Token Sale will offer 50,000,000 CEDEX Coins, at a rate of 1 ETH = 900 CEDEX Coins.

Up to 25,000,000 of the coins will be sold in the pre-sale and the remainder during the main-sale.

All of the tokens supply will distributed shortly after completion of the Token Sale. 

Any tokens offered for sale to the public that are not sold will be destroyed.

Users will be able to purchase CEDEX Coin in Ether, Bitcoin and fiat currencies according to the available rates in the market.

A portion of the supply will be pre-allocated to the CEDEX founders and team members in the vesting schedule listed below.

The company will hold up to 10% of the CEDEX Coin supply for future development and marketing expansion. This holding 

will also be used for purchasing additional diamonds in order to expand the financial offering of the CEDEX project.

CONCLUSION

We have presented the CEDEX trading platform, which will turn diamonds into a tradable asset class. This paper 

explains the status quo in which the main problem hindering diamonds as a tradeable asset class is the very 

characteristic that the diamond industry promotes – each stone is unique. Consequently, there is a lack of 

transparency and liquidity, on the one hand, as diamonds change ownership via private transactions. On the other 

hand, there is an untapped investment market that we estimate at US $350 billion. Once CEDEX is launched, this 

investment market will start growing rapidly.

We have discussed our long-term vision of a diamond ecosystem based on blockchain technology and shown 

examples of other projects that are also based on tokenizing diamonds and in which all means of payments are digital. 

The market indicators for creating diamond market value transparency and coherence are established by the DEX, the 

CEDEX machine-learning algorithm that takes several factors into account. 

These factors include diamond financial and global inventory data, diamond prices and their individual rankings. 

Currently, the DEX is available for 0.3-, 0.5- and 1-carat round diamonds.

A considerable challenge has been to establish fungibility for diamonds to allow uniform trading. The CEDEX platform 

will solve this problem by applying the DEX algorithm and creating a smart-contract that represents a gemologically 

validated asset. Consequently, it is possible to apply innovative trading mechanisms employing blockchain-based 

tokens, such as category trading, short selling or ETF trading, to the diamond industry. We stress that these 

mechanisms are not a complete set. In the future, more diamond-trading mechanisms will be developed with 

blockchain-based tokenization of diamonds being the technological enabler.

The Diamond-Smart Contracts will be transparently registered on the blockchain to achieve full diamond-trading 

traceability. This will allow Diamond-Smart Contracts, representing fungible diamonds, to be traded on the CEDEX 

platform or P2P by professional traders in a decentralized way. Consequently, we will enable single-diamond trading, 

uploading diamonds for sale and also taking physical delivery by a trader in which all related events are stored on the 

blockchain. The result will be the establishment of a two-sided market for diamond trading.

While the deployment feasibility of the CEDEX system is positive, limitations of this paper pertain to the CEDEX 

platform being a decentralized and distributed diamond-trading platform with complex business semantics flowing 

across system components that must be cross-component dependable and free of concurrency conflicts.

CONCLUSION

We have presented the CEDEX trading platform, which will turn diamonds into a tradable asset class. This paper 

explains the status quo in which the main problem hindering diamonds as a tradeable asset class is the very 

characteristic that the diamond industry promotes – each stone is unique. Consequently, there is a lack of 

transparency and liquidity, on the one hand, as diamonds change ownership via private transactions. On the other 

hand, there is an untapped investment market that we estimate at US $350 billion. Once CEDEX is launched, this 

investment market will start growing rapidly.

We have discussed our long-term vision of a diamond ecosystem based on blockchain technology and shown 

examples of other projects that are also based on tokenizing diamonds and in which all means of payments are digital. 

The market indicators for creating diamond market value transparency and coherence are established by the DEX, the 

CEDEX machine-learning algorithm that takes several factors into account. 

These factors include diamond financial and global inventory data, diamond prices and their individual rankings. 

Currently, the DEX is available for 0.3-, 0.5- and 1-carat round diamonds.

A considerable challenge has been to establish fungibility for diamonds to allow uniform trading. The CEDEX platform 

will solve this problem by applying the DEX algorithm and creating a smart-contract that represents a gemologically 

validated asset. Consequently, it is possible to apply innovative trading mechanisms employing blockchain-based 

tokens, such as category trading, short selling or ETF trading, to the diamond industry. We stress that these 

mechanisms are not a complete set. In the future, more diamond-trading mechanisms will be developed with 

blockchain-based tokenization of diamonds being the technological enabler.

The Diamond-Smart Contracts will be transparently registered on the blockchain to achieve full diamond-trading 

Page 22

traceability. This will allow Diamond-Smart Contracts, representing fungible diamonds, to be traded on the CEDEX 

platform or P2P by professional traders in a decentralized way. Consequently, we will enable single-diamond trading, 

uploading diamonds for sale and also taking physical delivery by a trader in which all related events are stored on the 

blockchain. The result will be the establishment of a two-sided market for diamond trading.

While the deployment feasibility of the CEDEX system is positive, limitations of this paper pertain to the CEDEX 

platform being a decentralized and distributed diamond-trading platform with complex business semantics flowing 

across system components that must be cross-component dependable and free of concurrency conflicts.

APPENDIX A - CEDEX COIN TOKEN OFFERING

The pre-sale offering will be conducted over a maximum period of 10 days, or, or until the pre-sale cap is reached. The 

pre-sale will begin on March 16th, 2018 at 10:00 GMT. The main-sale start date will be dictated by the completion of the 

pre-sale. The main-sale will commence at 10:00 GMT on the day following the close of the pre-sale and will last 28 days or 

until the maximum cap is reached.

The CEDEX project will issue a maximum of 100,000,000 CEDEX Coins.

The Token Sale will offer 50,000,000 CEDEX Coins, at a rate of 1 ETH = 900 CEDEX Coins.

Up to 25,000,000 of the coins will be sold in the pre-sale and the remainder during the main-sale.

All of the tokens supply will distributed shortly after completion of the Token Sale. 

Any tokens offered for sale to the public that are not sold will be destroyed.

Users will be able to purchase CEDEX Coin in Ether, Bitcoin and fiat currencies according to the available rates in the market.

A portion of the supply will be pre-allocated to the CEDEX founders and team members in the vesting schedule listed below.

The company will hold up to 10% of the CEDEX Coin supply for future development and marketing expansion. This holding 

will also be used for purchasing additional diamonds in order to expand the financial offering of the CEDEX project.

APPENDIX C - EXECUTION & BUSINESS ROAD MAP 

The CEDEX project was launched at the beginning of 2017. The CEDEX team has already achieved extensive 

business and technological milestones, as illustrated in Fig. 10.

In October 2017, TechFinancials announced the project to the public. AIM Announcement October 23, 2018

Below we have detailed the four milestones that are the building blocks of the CEDEX project. 

Q4 2017 MILESTONE 1 – THE DEX 

The first milestone and major achievement of the CEDEX technology and diamond teams is the creation of an alpha 

version of the DEX. As explained in detail above, the DEX is an algorithm that compiles all relevant market and 

technical data and creates a machine-learning engine to evaluate a diamond’s market price and rate its asking price 

accordingly. The alpha version of the DEX is already operational on the cedex.com website.

Q4 2018 MILESTONE 2 MVP LAUNCH (MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT) OF THE CEDEX PLATFORM

The second milestone is to finish the MVP product, complete the regulatory framework for launching the product in 

the first locale and start marketing activities in order to drive traffic to the platform. The MVP will allow traders to buy, 

sell or take physical delivery of a diamond.

- Web Trading Arena

- Web Mobile Trading Arena 

Operational Back Of�ce system 

- CRM 

- Diamond Upload – integration with diamond ERP system

- Wallet Management

- Compliance Management

- Configuration Management

Q2 2019 MILESTONE 3 – FINANCIAL OFFERING EXPANSION AND REGULATION 

The next step in the evolution of making diamonds a commodity is the ability to transform them from a one-of-a-kind 

asset to a homogeneous asset. CEDEX’s innovative solution combines blockchain technology and the proprietary 

developed algorithm to create a Category Trading.

Category trading is the building block for future development of the asset class, allowing traders to get exposure to 

different diamond categories, short selling a category and expanding to complex derivatives.    

As the CEDEX platform evolves, we expect professional traders and financial institutions utilizing this new financial 

product to offer their clients exposure to their existing portfolios. 

Such expansion of the diamond investment market will be followed by the addition of more regulation to the 

Exchange to secure traders and to adhere to local regulatory constraints.

In terms of financial offering development, we plan to expand the CEDEX offering and start introducing complex 

derivative products such as leveraged ETFs, short leveraged ETFs, cross categories products, high-value diamonds 

ETFs, future contracts and so on. 

Q4 2019 MILESTONE 4 – GEO EXPANSION 

Once the CEDEX is adopted in the initial locale, the exchange business roadmap is planned to expand to additional 

markets. To allow such expansion, the CEDEX will require regulatory licenses to comply with each country's  

regulatory requirements.

Each geographical expansion will result in additional usage and demand for CEDEX Coin as new traders receive 

access to the CEDEX Exchange.

   



Q4 2017 MILESTONE 1 – THE DEX 

The first milestone and major achievement of the CEDEX technology and diamond teams is the creation of an alpha 

version of the DEX. As explained in detail above, the DEX is an algorithm that compiles all relevant market and

The second milestone is to finish the MVP product, complete the regulatory framework for launching the product in 

the first locale and start marketing activities in order to drive traffic to the platform. The MVP will allow traders to buy, 

sell or take physical delivery of a diamond.

We shall have no liability for losses or damages (whether direct, indirect, consequential or any other kind of loss or damage) arising out of the use, 
reference to or reliance on the contents of this whitepaper, even if advised of the possibility of damages arising.  

This whitepaper may contain references to third party data and industry publications. As far as we are aware, the information reproduced in this 
whitepaper is accurate and that the estimates and assumptions contained herein are reasonable. However, we offer no assurances as to the 
accuracy or completeness of this data. Although information and data reproduced in this whitepaper are believed to have been obtained from 
reliable sources, we have not independently veri�ed any of the information or data from third party sources referred to in this whitepaper or 
ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.

As of the date of publication of this whitepaper, CEDEX tokens (the “Tokens”) have no known or intended future use (other than on CEDEX 
network/platform which is still under development) (the “Network”).  The intended purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of 
services  through the Network as set forth in this whitepaper (collectively, the “Services”). 

No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to CEDEX, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of any 
payments, and no guarantee that CEDEX will hold any particular value.  Unless prospective participants fully understand and accept the nature of 
CEDEX business and the potential risks associated with the acquisition, storage and transfer of ERC-20 tokens such as CEDEX tokens, they 
should not participate in the token sale. 

CEDEX tokens are not being structured or intended to be sold as securities. CEDEX tokens hold no rights and confer no interests in the equity of 
CEDEX. CEDEX tokens are sold with an intended future use on CEDEX platform and all proceeds received during the token sale may be spent 
freely by CEDEX on the development of its business and the underlying technological infrastructure.

This whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or disclosure document and is not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of any offer to buy any 
investment or �nancial instrument in any jurisdiction. CEDEX tokens should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the 
expectation of making an investment return. 

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this whitepaper. No such action has or will be taken under the 
laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this whitepaper does not imply that 
applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with. 

Participation in the token sale carries substantial risk and may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of your 
contribution as stated herein. Further information about the risks of participating in the token sale is set out in the Token Sale T&Cs. Please ensure 
that you have read, understood and are prepared to accept the risks of participating in the token sale before sending a contribution to us. 

The Tokens are designed and intended to perform as a functional utility for use only on the Company’s business platform that is yet to be 
developed. The token sale and/or CEDEX tokens could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential restrictions on the ownership, use, or 
possession of such tokens. Regulators or other competent authorities may demand that we revise the mechanics of the token sale and/or the 
functionality of CEDEX tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business obligations. Nevertheless, we 
believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the token sale mechanics and issue of CEDEX tokens do not violate applicable 
laws and regulations.  We have used reasonable endeavours to approach the token sale in a responsible and sensible manner. Given the legal 
uncertain of distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and 
activities in a number of jurisdictions, we have spent time and resources to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now 
and in the future. 

It is possible that CEDEX Tokens described in this whitepaper and which are the subject of the token sale may comprise a security in your 
jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in either of these 
cases the Company may be liable for the same. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances. You 
are strongly advised to take independent legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your participation in the token sale and 
purchase of Tokens.

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of CEDEX Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. 
Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing CEDEX Tokens may result in loss of such CEDEX 
Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet 
service you use, may be able to misappropriate your CEDEX Tokens.   
Because CEDEX Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum 
protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or CEDEX Tokens.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such 
as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the CEDEX Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic 
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.   

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the CEDEX Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the 
course of validating CEDEX Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining 
power attacks, and sel�sh-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the CEDEX Tokens, including, but not limited 
to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.  

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the CEDEX Tokens in a variety of ways, including, 
but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smur�ng and spoo�ng.  Furthermore, 
because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or 
unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the CEDEX 
Tokens.   

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other �nancial institutions, CEDEX Tokens are uninsured unless you speci�cally obtain private 
insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer 
recourse to you.

The regulatory status of the CEDEX Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is dif�cult to predict 
how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and 
the CEDEX Tokens. It is likewise dif�cult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and 
regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens. Regulatory actions could 
negatively impact the Network and the CEDEX Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that 
CEDEX Tokens are a regulated �nancial instrument that require registration or licensing.  Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the 
event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain 
the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.  

The tax characterization of CEDEX Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and utilizing 
CEDEX Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added 
taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements. 
  
It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The 
Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.

It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public 
interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such lack of use or interest could 
negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential functionality of CEDEX Tokens.  

The Network is still under development and may undergo signi�cant changes over time. Although we intend for the CEDEX Tokens and Network to 
follow the speci�cations set forth in this whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends (subject to internal business 
description), we may have to make changes to the speci�cations of the CEDEX Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.  This 

could create the risk that the CEDEX Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of 
purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience 
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.     

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable �uctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other 
cryptographic and �at currencies), decrease in the CEDEX Tokens’ functionality due to negative adoption of the Network, the failure of commercial 
relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve. 

Because CEDEX Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate af�liates, all decisions 
involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to 
discontinue the Network, to create and sell more CEDEX Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could 
adversely affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens you hold. 
As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the 
Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The Services may involve the storage of large amounts of 
sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services 
may be interrupted and �les may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a 
variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted 
based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the 
Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could 
adversely affect the Network and therefore the future functionality of any CEDEX Tokens that you hold.     
Cryptographic tokens such as the CEDEX Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks 
associated with your purchase, holding and use of CEDEX Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further 
materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.     

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that relate to our current expecta-
tions of future events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identi�ed by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, 
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the negative of these terms, or other 
similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about 
future events and �nancial trends that we believe are relevant to our �nancial condition, results of operations, business strategy, �nancial needs, or 
the results of the token sale. 

In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements related to CEDEX proposed 
operating model. The model speaks to our objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by CEDEX in light of its experience and perception of historical 
trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to risks and uncertain-
ties. Although the forward-looking statements contained in this whitepaper are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, there are 
risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors which could cause our actual results, performances, achievements and/or experiences to differ 
materially from the expectations expressed, implied, or perceived in forward-looking statements. Given such risks, prospective participants in the 
token sale should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, RISKS AND DISCLAIMER 
FOR WHITEPAPER

Last Updated March 14, 2018

This whitepaper is for information purposes only and may be subject to change. CEDEX (the “Company”, “CEDEX”, “we”, or “us”) cannot 
guarantee the accuracy of the statements made or conclusions reached in this whitepaper and we expressly disclaim all representations and 
warranties (whether express or implied by statute or otherwise) whatsoever, including but not limited to: 

any representations or warranties relating to merchantability, �tness for a particular purpose, suitability, title or non-infringement; 
that the contents of this document are accurate and free from any errors; and
that such contents do not infringe any third party rights. 

We shall have no liability for losses or damages (whether direct, indirect, consequential or any other kind of loss or damage) arising out of the use, 
reference to or reliance on the contents of this whitepaper, even if advised of the possibility of damages arising.  

This whitepaper may contain references to third party data and industry publications. As far as we are aware, the information reproduced in this 
whitepaper is accurate and that the estimates and assumptions contained herein are reasonable. However, we offer no assurances as to the 
accuracy or completeness of this data. Although information and data reproduced in this whitepaper are believed to have been obtained from 
reliable sources, we have not independently veri�ed any of the information or data from third party sources referred to in this whitepaper or 
ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.

As of the date of publication of this whitepaper, CEDEX tokens (the “Tokens”) have no known or intended future use (other than on CEDEX 
network/platform which is still under development) (the “Network”).  The intended purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of 
services  through the Network as set forth in this whitepaper (collectively, the “Services”). 

No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to CEDEX, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of any 
payments, and no guarantee that CEDEX will hold any particular value.  Unless prospective participants fully understand and accept the nature of 
CEDEX business and the potential risks associated with the acquisition, storage and transfer of ERC-20 tokens such as CEDEX tokens, they 
should not participate in the token sale. 

CEDEX tokens are not being structured or intended to be sold as securities. CEDEX tokens hold no rights and confer no interests in the equity of 
CEDEX. CEDEX tokens are sold with an intended future use on CEDEX platform and all proceeds received during the token sale may be spent 
freely by CEDEX on the development of its business and the underlying technological infrastructure.

This whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or disclosure document and is not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of any offer to buy any 
investment or �nancial instrument in any jurisdiction. CEDEX tokens should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the 
expectation of making an investment return. 

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this whitepaper. No such action has or will be taken under the 
laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this whitepaper does not imply that 
applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with. 

Participation in the token sale carries substantial risk and may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of your 
contribution as stated herein. Further information about the risks of participating in the token sale is set out in the Token Sale T&Cs. Please ensure 
that you have read, understood and are prepared to accept the risks of participating in the token sale before sending a contribution to us. 

The Tokens are designed and intended to perform as a functional utility for use only on the Company’s business platform that is yet to be 
developed. The token sale and/or CEDEX tokens could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential restrictions on the ownership, use, or 
possession of such tokens. Regulators or other competent authorities may demand that we revise the mechanics of the token sale and/or the 
functionality of CEDEX tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business obligations. Nevertheless, we 
believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the token sale mechanics and issue of CEDEX tokens do not violate applicable 
laws and regulations.  We have used reasonable endeavours to approach the token sale in a responsible and sensible manner. Given the legal 
uncertain of distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and 
activities in a number of jurisdictions, we have spent time and resources to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now 
and in the future. 

It is possible that CEDEX Tokens described in this whitepaper and which are the subject of the token sale may comprise a security in your 
jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in either of these 
cases the Company may be liable for the same. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances. You 
are strongly advised to take independent legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your participation in the token sale and 
purchase of Tokens.

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of CEDEX Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. 
Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing CEDEX Tokens may result in loss of such CEDEX 
Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet 
service you use, may be able to misappropriate your CEDEX Tokens.   
Because CEDEX Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum 
protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or CEDEX Tokens.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such 
as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the CEDEX Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic 
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.   

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the CEDEX Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the 
course of validating CEDEX Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining 
power attacks, and sel�sh-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the CEDEX Tokens, including, but not limited 
to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.  

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the CEDEX Tokens in a variety of ways, including, 
but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smur�ng and spoo�ng.  Furthermore, 
because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or 
unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the CEDEX 
Tokens.   

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other �nancial institutions, CEDEX Tokens are uninsured unless you speci�cally obtain private 
insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer 
recourse to you.

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that relate to our current expecta-
tions of future events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identi�ed by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, 
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the negative of these terms, or other 
similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about 
future events and �nancial trends that we believe are relevant to our �nancial condition, results of operations, business strategy, �nancial needs, or 
the results of the token sale. 

In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements related to CEDEX proposed

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, RISKS AND DISCLAIMER 
FOR WHITEPAPER

Last Updated March 14, 2018

This whitepaper is for information purposes only and may be subject to change. CEDEX (the “Company”, “CEDEX”, “we”, or “us”) cannot 
guarantee the accuracy of the statements made or conclusions reached in this whitepaper and we expressly disclaim all representations and 
warranties (whether express or implied by statute or otherwise) whatsoever, including but not limited to: 

any representations or warranties relating to merchantability, �tness for a particular purpose, suitability, title or non-infringement; 
that the contents of this document are accurate and free from any errors; and
that such contents do not infringe any third party rights. 

We shall have no liability for losses or damages (whether direct, indirect, consequential or any other kind of loss or damage) arising out of the use, 
reference to or reliance on the contents of this whitepaper, even if advised of the possibility of damages arising.  

This whitepaper may contain references to third party data and industry publications. As far as we are aware, the information reproduced in this 
whitepaper is accurate and that the estimates and assumptions contained herein are reasonable. However, we offer no assurances as to the 
accuracy or completeness of this data. Although information and data reproduced in this whitepaper are believed to have been obtained from 
reliable sources, we have not independently veri�ed any of the information or data from third party sources referred to in this whitepaper or 
ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.

As of the date of publication of this whitepaper, CEDEX tokens (the “Tokens”) have no known or intended future use (other than on CEDEX 
network/platform which is still under development) (the “Network”).  The intended purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of 
services  through the Network as set forth in this whitepaper (collectively, the “Services”). 

No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to CEDEX, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of any 
payments, and no guarantee that CEDEX will hold any particular value.  Unless prospective participants fully understand and accept the nature of 
CEDEX business and the potential risks associated with the acquisition, storage and transfer of ERC-20 tokens such as CEDEX tokens, they 
should not participate in the token sale. 

CEDEX tokens are not being structured or intended to be sold as securities. CEDEX tokens hold no rights and confer no interests in the equity of 
CEDEX. CEDEX tokens are sold with an intended future use on CEDEX platform and all proceeds received during the token sale may be spent 
freely by CEDEX on the development of its business and the underlying technological infrastructure.

This whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or disclosure document and is not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of any offer to buy any 
investment or �nancial instrument in any jurisdiction. CEDEX tokens should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the 
expectation of making an investment return. 

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this whitepaper. No such action has or will be taken under the 
laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this whitepaper does not imply that 
applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with. 

Participation in the token sale carries substantial risk and may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of your 
contribution as stated herein. Further information about the risks of participating in the token sale is set out in the Token Sale T&Cs. Please ensure 
that you have read, understood and are prepared to accept the risks of participating in the token sale before sending a contribution to us. 

The Tokens are designed and intended to perform as a functional utility for use only on the Company’s business platform that is yet to be 
developed. The token sale and/or CEDEX tokens could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential restrictions on the ownership, use, or 
possession of such tokens. Regulators or other competent authorities may demand that we revise the mechanics of the token sale and/or the 
functionality of CEDEX tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business obligations. Nevertheless, we 
believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the token sale mechanics and issue of CEDEX tokens do not violate applicable 
laws and regulations.  We have used reasonable endeavours to approach the token sale in a responsible and sensible manner. Given the legal 
uncertain of distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and 
activities in a number of jurisdictions, we have spent time and resources to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now 
and in the future. 

It is possible that CEDEX Tokens described in this whitepaper and which are the subject of the token sale may comprise a security in your 
jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in either of these 
cases the Company may be liable for the same. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances. You 
are strongly advised to take independent legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your participation in the token sale and 
purchase of Tokens.

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of CEDEX Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. 
Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing CEDEX Tokens may result in loss of such CEDEX 
Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet 
service you use, may be able to misappropriate your CEDEX Tokens.   
Because CEDEX Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum 
protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or CEDEX Tokens.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such 
as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the CEDEX Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic 
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.   

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the CEDEX Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the 
course of validating CEDEX Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining 
power attacks, and sel�sh-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the CEDEX Tokens, including, but not limited 
to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.  

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the CEDEX Tokens in a variety of ways, including, 
but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smur�ng and spoo�ng.  Furthermore, 
because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or 
unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the CEDEX 
Tokens.   

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other �nancial institutions, CEDEX Tokens are uninsured unless you speci�cally obtain private 
insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer 
recourse to you.

The regulatory status of the CEDEX Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is dif�cult to predict 
how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and 
the CEDEX Tokens. It is likewise dif�cult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and 
regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens. Regulatory actions could 
negatively impact the Network and the CEDEX Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that 
CEDEX Tokens are a regulated �nancial instrument that require registration or licensing.  Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the 
event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain 
the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.  

The tax characterization of CEDEX Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and utilizing 
CEDEX Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added 
taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements. 
  
It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The 
Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.

It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public 
interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such lack of use or interest could 
negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential functionality of CEDEX Tokens.  

The Network is still under development and may undergo signi�cant changes over time. Although we intend for the CEDEX Tokens and Network to 
follow the speci�cations set forth in this whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends (subject to internal business 
description), we may have to make changes to the speci�cations of the CEDEX Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.  This 

could create the risk that the CEDEX Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of 
purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience 
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.     

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable �uctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other 
cryptographic and �at currencies), decrease in the CEDEX Tokens’ functionality due to negative adoption of the Network, the failure of commercial 
relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve. 

Because CEDEX Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate af�liates, all decisions 
involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to 
discontinue the Network, to create and sell more CEDEX Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could 
adversely affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens you hold. 
As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the 
Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The Services may involve the storage of large amounts of 
sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services 
may be interrupted and �les may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a 
variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted 
based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the 
Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could 
adversely affect the Network and therefore the future functionality of any CEDEX Tokens that you hold.     
Cryptographic tokens such as the CEDEX Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks 
associated with your purchase, holding and use of CEDEX Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further 
materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.     

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that relate to our current expecta-
tions of future events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identi�ed by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, 
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the negative of these terms, or other 
similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about 
future events and �nancial trends that we believe are relevant to our �nancial condition, results of operations, business strategy, �nancial needs, or 
the results of the token sale. 

In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements related to CEDEX proposed 
operating model. The model speaks to our objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by CEDEX in light of its experience and perception of historical 
trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to risks and uncertain-
ties. Although the forward-looking statements contained in this whitepaper are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, there are 
risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors which could cause our actual results, performances, achievements and/or experiences to differ 
materially from the expectations expressed, implied, or perceived in forward-looking statements. Given such risks, prospective participants in the 
token sale should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, RISKS AND DISCLAIMER 
FOR WHITEPAPER

Last Updated March 14, 2018

This whitepaper is for information purposes only and may be subject to change. CEDEX (the “Company”, “CEDEX”, “we”, or “us”) cannot 
guarantee the accuracy of the statements made or conclusions reached in this whitepaper and we expressly disclaim all representations and 
warranties (whether express or implied by statute or otherwise) whatsoever, including but not limited to: 

any representations or warranties relating to merchantability, �tness for a particular purpose, suitability, title or non-infringement; 
that the contents of this document are accurate and free from any errors; and
that such contents do not infringe any third party rights. 

We shall have no liability for losses or damages (whether direct, indirect, consequential or any other kind of loss or damage) arising out of the use, 
reference to or reliance on the contents of this whitepaper, even if advised of the possibility of damages arising.  

This whitepaper may contain references to third party data and industry publications. As far as we are aware, the information reproduced in this 
whitepaper is accurate and that the estimates and assumptions contained herein are reasonable. However, we offer no assurances as to the 
accuracy or completeness of this data. Although information and data reproduced in this whitepaper are believed to have been obtained from 
reliable sources, we have not independently veri�ed any of the information or data from third party sources referred to in this whitepaper or 
ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.

As of the date of publication of this whitepaper, CEDEX tokens (the “Tokens”) have no known or intended future use (other than on CEDEX 
network/platform which is still under development) (the “Network”).  The intended purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of 
services  through the Network as set forth in this whitepaper (collectively, the “Services”). 

No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to CEDEX, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of any 
payments, and no guarantee that CEDEX will hold any particular value.  Unless prospective participants fully understand and accept the nature of 
CEDEX business and the potential risks associated with the acquisition, storage and transfer of ERC-20 tokens such as CEDEX tokens, they 
should not participate in the token sale. 

CEDEX tokens are not being structured or intended to be sold as securities. CEDEX tokens hold no rights and confer no interests in the equity of 
CEDEX. CEDEX tokens are sold with an intended future use on CEDEX platform and all proceeds received during the token sale may be spent 
freely by CEDEX on the development of its business and the underlying technological infrastructure.

This whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or disclosure document and is not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of any offer to buy any 
investment or �nancial instrument in any jurisdiction. CEDEX tokens should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the 
expectation of making an investment return. 

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this whitepaper. No such action has or will be taken under the 
laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this whitepaper does not imply that 
applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with.

Participation in the token sale carries substantial risk and may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of your 
contribution as stated herein. Further information about the risks of participating in the token sale is set out in the Token Sale T&Cs. Please ensure 
that you have read, understood and are prepared to accept the risks of participating in the token sale before sending a contribution to us. 

The Tokens are designed and intended to perform as a functional utility for use only on the Company’s business platform that is yet to be 
developed. The token sale and/or CEDEX tokens could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential restrictions on the ownership, use, or 
possession of such tokens. Regulators or other competent authorities may demand that we revise the mechanics of the token sale and/or the 
functionality of CEDEX tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business obligations. Nevertheless, we 
believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the token sale mechanics and issue of CEDEX tokens do not violate applicable 
laws and regulations.  We have used reasonable endeavours to approach the token sale in a responsible and sensible manner. Given the legal 
uncertain of distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and 
activities in a number of jurisdictions, we have spent time and resources to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now 
and in the future. 

It is possible that CEDEX Tokens described in this whitepaper and which are the subject of the token sale may comprise a security in your 
jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in either of these 
cases the Company may be liable for the same. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances. You 
are strongly advised to take independent legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your participation in the token sale and 
purchase of Tokens.

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of CEDEX Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. 
Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing CEDEX Tokens may result in loss of such CEDEX 
Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet 
service you use, may be able to misappropriate your CEDEX Tokens.   
Because CEDEX Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum 
protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or CEDEX Tokens.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such 
as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the CEDEX Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic 
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.   

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the CEDEX Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the 
course of validating CEDEX Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining 
power attacks, and sel�sh-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the CEDEX Tokens, including, but not limited 
to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.  

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the CEDEX Tokens in a variety of ways, including, 
but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smur�ng and spoo�ng.  Furthermore, 
because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or 
unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the CEDEX 
Tokens.   

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other �nancial institutions, CEDEX Tokens are uninsured unless you speci�cally obtain private 
insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer 
recourse to you.

The regulatory status of the CEDEX Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is dif�cult to predict 
how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and 
the CEDEX Tokens. It is likewise dif�cult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and 
regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens. Regulatory actions could 
negatively impact the Network and the CEDEX Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that 
CEDEX Tokens are a regulated �nancial instrument that require registration or licensing.  Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the 
event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain 
the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.  

The tax characterization of CEDEX Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and utilizing 
CEDEX Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added 
taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements. 
  
It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The 
Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.

It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public 
interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such lack of use or interest could 
negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential functionality of CEDEX Tokens.  

The Network is still under development and may undergo signi�cant changes over time. Although we intend for the CEDEX Tokens and Network to 
follow the speci�cations set forth in this whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends (subject to internal business 
description), we may have to make changes to the speci�cations of the CEDEX Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.  This 

could create the risk that the CEDEX Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of 
purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience 
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.     

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable �uctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other 
cryptographic and �at currencies), decrease in the CEDEX Tokens’ functionality due to negative adoption of the Network, the failure of commercial 
relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve. 

Because CEDEX Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate af�liates, all decisions 
involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to 
discontinue the Network, to create and sell more CEDEX Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could 
adversely affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens you hold. 
As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the 
Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The Services may involve the storage of large amounts of 
sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services 
may be interrupted and �les may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a 
variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted 
based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the 
Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could 
adversely affect the Network and therefore the future functionality of any CEDEX Tokens that you hold.     
Cryptographic tokens such as the CEDEX Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks 
associated with your purchase, holding and use of CEDEX Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further 
materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.     

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that relate to our current expecta-
tions of future events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identi�ed by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, 
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the negative of these terms, or other 
similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about 
future events and �nancial trends that we believe are relevant to our �nancial condition, results of operations, business strategy, �nancial needs, or 
the results of the token sale. 

In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements related to CEDEX proposed 
operating model. The model speaks to our objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by CEDEX in light of its experience and perception of historical 
trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to risks and uncertain-
ties. Although the forward-looking statements contained in this whitepaper are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, there are 
risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors which could cause our actual results, performances, achievements and/or experiences to differ 
materially from the expectations expressed, implied, or perceived in forward-looking statements. Given such risks, prospective participants in the 
token sale should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

the CEDEX Tokens. It is likewise dif�cult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and 
regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens. Regulatory actions could 
negatively impact the Network and the CEDEX Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that 
CEDEX Tokens are a regulated �nancial instrument that require registration or licensing.  Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the 
event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain 
the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.  

The tax characterization of CEDEX Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and utilizing 
CEDEX Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added 
taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements. 
  
It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The 
Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.

It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public 
interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such lack of use or interest could 
negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential functionality of CEDEX Tokens.  

The Network is still under development and may undergo signi�cant changes over time. Although we intend for the CEDEX Tokens and Network to 
follow the speci�cations set forth in this whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends (subject to internal business 
description), we may have to make changes to the speci�cations of the CEDEX Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.  This 

could create the risk that the CEDEX Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of 
purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience 
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens.     

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable �uctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other 
cryptographic and �at currencies), decrease in the CEDEX Tokens’ functionality due to negative adoption of the Network, the failure of commercial 
relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve. 

Because CEDEX Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate af�liates, all decisions 
involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to 
discontinue the Network, to create and sell more CEDEX Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could 
adversely affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens you hold. 
As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the 
Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The Services may involve the storage of large amounts of 
sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services 
may be interrupted and �les may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a 
variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted 
based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the 
Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could 
adversely affect the Network and therefore the future functionality of any CEDEX Tokens that you hold.     
Cryptographic tokens such as the CEDEX Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks 
associated with your purchase, holding and use of CEDEX Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further 
materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.     

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that relate to our current expecta-
tions of future events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identi�ed by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, 
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the negative of these terms, or other 
similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about 
future events and �nancial trends that we believe are relevant to our �nancial condition, results of operations, business strategy, �nancial needs, or 
the results of the token sale. 

In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements related to CEDEX proposed 
operating model. The model speaks to our objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by CEDEX in light of its experience and perception of historical 
trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to risks and uncertain-
ties. Although the forward-looking statements contained in this whitepaper are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, there are 
risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors which could cause our actual results, performances, achievements and/or experiences to differ 
materially from the expectations expressed, implied, or perceived in forward-looking statements. Given such risks, prospective participants in the 
token sale should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
