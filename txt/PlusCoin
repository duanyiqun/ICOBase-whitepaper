PlusCoin ICO of Metaps Plus will be the world’s first case in which a company 

with sufficient capital to maintain an orderly market issues cryptocurrency.  The 

cryptocurrency ecosystem Metaps Plus intends to build is a stable transaction 

system that is designed to closely relate to the real-world economy, rather than 

forming a cryptocurrency trading which is separated from the real-world 

economy, and aims to provide protection to PLC owners and guarantee free 

trading thereof.  �

1. Introduction/Background to Issuance of Cryptocurrency

Within ten years after the first appearance of ‘Bitcoin’ in 2008, the world’s initial 

cryptocurrency, a huge market has been developed in which cryptocurrencies 

worth $6.35 billion (KRW 7.2 trillion) is being traded3 .  Since the appearance of 

Ethereum in 2015, cryptocurrencies are facing a new phrase – with realization 

of the concept of ‘smart contracts,’ introduction of the ERC-20 token standards, 

and establishment of platforms for ICO, various block-chain based businesses 

can now publish tokens to raise capital.

ICOs after Ethereum can be divided into two categories: (a) ICOs aiming to de-

velop platforms by developing and distributing new blockchains (e.g. EOS, IOTA, 

COSMOS), and (b) ICOs aiming to resolve specific problems by issuing tokens 

on already existing blockchain platforms (e.g. BAT, Steem, Status).  PLC of 

Metaps Plus takes the latter approach, and aims to overcome various business 

limitations of the real world or various technical limitations of the existing serv-

er-client structure, through the characteristics of distributed ledger and smart 

contracts.

2. Novelty of PLC

2. 1. Protection of currency value and investors
 (Connection to the real-world economy)

Having become rapidly popularized, blockchain technology is now being viewed 

as a new investment target which can overcome limitations and shortcomings of 

the existing stock markets.  On the other hand, damages are increasingly incurred 

by token buyers due to indiscreet ICOs lacking even the minimum credibility in 

companies and minimum buyer protection mechanisms, in a situation where 

related laws and regulations are not yet prepared.   In order to stabilize cryptocur-

rency values and to prevent situations in which cryptocurrencies will become 

investment vehicles with frequent price fluctuations, blockchains should be con-

nected to the real-world economic system.  Ultimately, a paradigm shift should 

take place to enable entities with substantial capital and assets to build token 

ecosystems, and in this regard, Metaps Plus, being a company operating mobile 

fintech business, would like to propose this contemplated PlusCoin ICO.   

Metaps Plus, the issuer of PLC, is a FinTech company which runs the largest ap-

plication marketing reward platform NAS (trade mark registration no. 

4012646300000) in Korea, with 300 thousand daily users.  Metaps Plus sells 

mobile vouchers on 300 channels including Kakaotalk, ONE store, Facebook, and 

Naver Band etc. through its subsidiary Smartcon, and also owns infrastructures 

usable online and offline, such as POS (payment method, not stock certificate) 

equipment in all offline affiliate stores including BBQ, Megabox, and E-mart, and 

also major point program businesses, such as L.point, OK Cashbag, GS&POINT, 

and BC card.  Transactions through Smartcon amount to KRW 100 billion every 

year in Korea, in 34,000 affiliate stores.

ico_En.ai   6   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:50



By introducing blockchains to the already stabilized infrastructure, we intend to 

enable the users to enjoy future increase in the value of cryptocurrency as well as 

to utilize the current value thereof (using as a payment method, reduction of vari-

ous commissions for PLC owners, using as an international transaction method).  

These being goals which most of the pre-existing issuers of cryptocurrency 

aimed to reach but failed, PlusCoin ICO of Metaps Plus, which is the first attempt 

made by a stable payment network owner, will realize such goals. 

 

2. 2. Establishment of CoinRoom, a cryptocurrency exchange market

2. 2. 1. Advantages of CoinRoom

In Korea, the numbers of cryptocurrency exchange market users are increasing 

rapidly.  As of 14 July 2017, Bithumb’s Bitcoin transactions account for approxi-

mately 3% of the entire Bitcoin market worldwide.  With regard to Ethereum trans-

actions, Korea’s Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit are ranked as world’s 1st, 4th and 

11th market, respectively.  For Ripple, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ranking exchange markets 

are all Korean markets4.  Despite such outstanding trade volumes worldwide, 

Korean exchange markets have failed to earn good reputations.

The problems with the current cryptocurrency exchange markets can be summa-

rized as (a) security problems and (b) limitation in services (treatment of only 

limited types of cryptocurrencies, and inconveniences associated with related 

transactions, etc).  First of all, while blockchains are perceived as stable and

secure protocols due to the structure of its transaction, security within exchange 

markets which provide transactions of such cryptocurrency is another risk for 

the customers who intend to trade cryptocurrencies5 .  Cryptocurrency exchange 

markets utilize the old centralized client-server structure and store blockchain 

public keys (wallet addresses) and private keys of the customers in the server, 

making themselves vulnerable to server security breaches by outsider attacks or 

information leaks by insiders, in which cases the cryptocurrencies inside the 

exchange markets may be stolen without the blockchain networks being hacked. 

Second, the existing markets support only a few kinds of cryptocurrencies (Kor-

bit, which offers the widest array of cryptocurrency choices in Korea, is also 

known to support only 7 different kinds of tokens).  Especially, Korea-based 

exchange markets only offer trade options for legal currencies, so if users face 

difficulties in direct trading (such as Poloniex, Bittrex) and need to change a cer-

tain cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency (for example exchange Bitcoin 

with Ethereum), users must pay commission charges two times to the exchange 

market, and thus suffer great inconveniences thereby. 

 

Cryptocurrency CoinRoom is a cryptocurrency exchange market to be opened 

and run by Metaps Plus or another business entity to be newly established, in 

March 2018.  CoinRoom will be designed as an infrastructure with networks sep-

arated according to the Personal Information Management System (PIMS) and 

Information Security Management System (ISMS) managed by the Korea Inter-

net & Security Agency, and will make hacking impossible by introducing a with-

2. Novelty of PLC

5   During the last decade after the first introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain itself has 

not yet been hacked, but a few foreign exchange markets including Mt. Gox and Bitfinex faced 

large scale attacks by hackers.

drawal process with multifactor authentication and a verification mechanism for 

PlusCoin token owners regarding their ability to pay.

Also, CoinRoom will support DigiByte, Stratis, and other tokens currently not 

traded in Korea-based exchange markets, and will also provide direct transaction 

services between different cryptocurrencies, as well as transactions between 

Korean won and cryptocurrencies.  By being the first Korean exchange market 

which enables direct transition between cryptocurrencies with Ethereum as the 

base currency, CoinRoom will be able to offer its users a high degree of conveni-

ence which users cannot experience in other Korean exchange platforms.

2. Novelty of PLC

2. 2. 2. Additional benefits for PLC owners

 Owners of PlusCoin can receive certain benefits based on parts of the profit gen-

erated by the CoinRoom.  In order for the PlusCoin owners to receive such com-

pensation, tokens earned through PlusCoin ICO must be deposited in the Plus-

Coin customer wallets to be generated in the CoinRoom (Section 3.2. of this 

Whitepaper will discuss further about the benefits of PlusCoins offered by the 

CoinRoom).  PLC owners will enjoy gains from the operation of the CoinRoom 

from just owning the coins, with other owners of PlusCoin, regardless of future 

value increase of the tokens.

A company to be newly established will be in charge of the establishment and 

operation of the CoinRoom and granting of the benefits to the owners of Plus-

Coin, and such company is planned to be a subsidiary or affiliate of Metaps Plus.  

Tokens distributed through ICO are irrelevant to shares of the company who will 

operate CoinRoom, and certain benefits listed in this White Paper will be provid-

ed.

2. 3. Additional Benefits

2. 3. 1. PlusCoin SDK

There are many advertisement networks in the market, including NAS, a mobile 

advertisement platform run by Metaps Plus.  However, rewards collected by 

users are stored in each different medium and are thus difficult to combine.  Also, 

transfers of such rewards require complex and pricy procedures.  In this regard, 

Metaps Plus plans to launch PlusCoin SDK, which presents improvements to the 

pre-existing NAS, after the launching of PlusCoin ICO and the CoinRoom.

Based on the CoinRoom exchange market, PlusCoin SDK will be a service which 

provides rewards in the form of cryptocurrency and offers wallet management on 

mobile devices, and advertisers will be able to save advertisement fees based on 

the number of PlusCoins they own, or use PlusCoin directly as advertisement

fees.  Mediums and users will be able to easily transfer and exchange compensa-

tions accumulated through advertisements.   The two examples narrated below 

are examples of services provided through the accumulation of cryptocurrency 

rewards or mining games.

2.3.2. Payment system for mobile coupons

Smartcon, a subsidiary of Metaps Plus, runs the largest platform for mobile 

vouchers in Korea and generates approximately KRW 100 billion worth of trans-

actions with more than 200 brands and 34,000 stores every year.  ‘Gifticard,’ the 

representative mobile coupon of Smartcon, interacts with the users within major 

messengers such as Kakotalk and Line, and has built the following network, 

which can read barcodes which have been generated in real-time through offline 

store POS and process payment thereof.

ico_En.ai   13   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:52



2. Novelty of PLC

However, under the above infrastructure, every business entity participating in 

the coupon payment system must execute partnership agreements directly, and 

during the payment process, costs will be incurred due to verification procedures 

among various entities such as PG companies, card companies and banks, and 

such costs should be borne jointly by the relevant store and the coupon user.

Metaps Plus intends to establish a mobile coupon payment system which is ‘op-

erated on the basis of PLC’, by combining the liquidity of PLC and the advantages 

of blockchain, which does not require many entities for verification.  Such system 

will be provided in the forms of SDK or API, and each contracting store will be 

able to join the network via smart contracts, without any further processes for 

partnership.  Buyers of mobile coupons will receive discount premiums based on 

the amount of PLC owned, and sellers of mobile coupons will obtain opportuni-

ties to join discount bids based on the amount of PLC owned.  On this system, 

PLC will become an intermediate medium for combining and exchanging differ-

ent card points and mileages, and at the same time, will play a role of providing 

all possible information and values associated with the payment network to the 

full extent to PLC owners.

 

2.4. Money Flow Platform

Metaps Plus intends to complete a ‘Money Flow Platform’ which connects on/of-

fline commerce with cryptocurrency economy through CoinRoom and PlusCoin.  

The ultimate goal of this platform is to build a circular structure where points col-

lected through compensatory advertisements can be exchanged into cryptocur-

rencies through the CoinRoom, cryptocurrencies purchased in CoinRoom can be 

used for payments of mobile coupons, and points can be collected again during 

ico_En.ai   14   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:52



2. Novelty of PLC

such payment procedure.  PlusCoin ICO will build an ecosystem which provides 

stable benefits and success to coin owners through a predictable model, through 

the credibility of and operation of the exchange platform by the issuer.

ico_En.ai   15   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:52



3. Benefit Structure for Tokens

3.1. Introduction to issuance of tokens

PlusCoin is a standard ERC20 token distributed in the Ethereum blockchain net-

work.  Please refer to https://github.com/Onther-Tech/pluscoin-crowdsale for 

further details of the ICO.  In this ICO, ETH is the only measure available for ob-

taining PlusCoin. 

The primary value of PlusCoin is earning of benefits by the users, and for the 

achievement of this value, PlusCoin has prepared the following benefits regard-

ing certain rewards and return of CoinRoom exchange commissions.  Owners of 

PlusCoin can receive benefits based on the volume of transactions at the Coin-

Room exchange market, other than the profits earned by the value increase of 

PlusCoin.

3.2. Benefits for token holders

Rewards : 

After the end of each fiscal quarter of the CoinRoom, PlusCoin owners can 

receive, upon discretion and decision of the company operating the CoinRoom, 

certain rewards in the form of PlusCoin or ETH, provided that the amount does 

not exceed 10% of the portion of the CoinRoom’s profit generated by the transac-

tion commissions.  In the event the company operating the CoinRoom decides on 

an execution of rewards, first rewards are planned to be made in July, after the 

closing of the second quarter (April~June) of 2018, and grounds for the payment 

of such rewards can be found through the below ‘Search on Company Informa-

tion.’

ico_En.ai   16   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:53

https://github.com/Onther-Tech/pluscoin-crowdsale


Search on Company Information :

PlusCoin owners can view various information, such as the volume of transac-

tion, sales cost, and SG&A of the CoinRoom exchange market on the PlusCoin 

Premium Page, which is scheduled to open in March 2018 in the CoinRoom 

exchange market.

Discount on Exchange Commissions :

Based on the amount of PlusCoin owned, commissions paid by relevant PlusCoin 

owners for transactions within CoinRoom will be returned every quarter.  The per-

centages of commissions to be returned are as follows:

In order to verify token ownership, users should deposit PlusCoin in his/her pri-

vate wallets on the PlusCoin investors’ webpage, which is scheduled to open in 

January 2018 in the CoinRoom exchange market.

PlusCoins distributed through ICO before the opening of exchange market will be 

delivered to the private wallets (ERC20) of the ICO participants, and will be dis-

tributed via smart contract code, immediately upon the ICO participation.  For pri-

vate wallets, standard wallets such as MyEtherWallet, MetaMask or Mist, etc. are 

recommended.

3.3. Other token usage services

Apart from commission discounts at CoinRoom, we plan to develop and launch 

the following services for the full utilization of PlusCoin by the users.  Each ser-

vice includes benefits for PlusCoin owners:

PlusCoin SDK :

We plan to provide rewards in the form of mobile compensation advertisements 

through PlusCoin and other cryptocurrencies, develop a SDK suitable for wallet 

management and use of Exchange API, and thus plan to design major functions 

by reflecting the requests of Metaps Plus’s cooperative partners.  Different to the 

standard compensation advertisement SDK, advertisers can save advertisement 

fees based on the number of PlusCoin owned, or use PlusCoin itself to pay for the 

advertisement fees, and mediums and users will be able to easily transfer and 

exchange compensations accumulated through advertisements.

PlusCoin Store : 

 A store SDK or API where users can buy game moneys and vouchers for restau-

rants, convenient stores, beverages and gifts through PlusCoin and other crypto-

currencies.  The PlusCoin Store will serve as the contact point between the 

blockchain token-based mobile coupon payment service, which is scheduled to 

launch in July 2018, and its users.  It will be structured in a way to enable con-

sumers who own PlusCoins to receive discount premiums based on the amount 

of tokens owned, and sellers who own PlusCoins to enjoy freedom at discounted 

bids based on the amount of tokens owned.

3. Benefit Structure for Tokens

ico_En.ai   18   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:53



PlusCoin Leasing Services :

PlusCoin plans to provide services through which users can lease PlusCoin, 

having Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies held as securities.  Through 

the provision of such secured loan services, existing owners of cryptocurrencies 

may enjoy fluidity and use his/her credibility gained at the exchange market in 

the real-word economy.

3.4. Conditions for return of ETH used for purchase of PlusCoin

PlusCoin ICO by Metaps Plus will be carried out pursuant to the road map provid-

ed in this Whitepaper.  For the stable settlement of PlusCoin, we plan to launch a 

cryptocurrency exchange market called ‘CoinRoom’ by March 2018, as indicated 

in ‘Section 5. Schedule’ below. 

In the event CoinRoom fails to open its services by 30 March 2018 due to Metaps 

Plus or a subsidiary or other affiliate of Metaps Plus, Metaps Plus will, upon 

request, return the ETH used for the purchase of tokens through PlusCoin ICO.

6. Legal notifications

6.1. Audit

Yearly audits will be conducted on documents relating to coin publication (such 

as publication and distribution of coins, smart contract codes, etc.) and the 

financial statements of the exchange market by one of the four largest auditing 

firms, and relevant audit reports will be posted on the exchange market website.

6.2. Restrictions on nationality of ICO participants

Those who are a U.S., Singaporean, Chinese or Japanese national, those who 

reside in such countries or those who represent such person(s) cannot partici-

pate in the PlusCoin ICO of Metaps Plus.

6.3. Risk management regulations

Although publications and use of cryptocurrencies are increasing, not many 

countries regulate on cryptocurrencies by law.  However, there are worldwide de-

mands for regulatory frameworks on cryptocurrencies, and relevant regulatory 

bodies in Korea also have formed a TFT in November 2016 to prepare for an intro-

duction of a regulatory oversight.

Depending on the future introduction of related regulations, publications and use 

of cryptocurrencies may be restricted, and the terms and conditions provided for 

in this Whitepaper and the Purchase Terms and Conditions which will be posted 

separately may be subject to changes.  In the event any changes need to be 

made to this Whitepaper or the terms and conditions of sales in order to refrain 

from violating any establishment of or amendment to relevant laws or regula-

ico_En.ai   25   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:55



6. Legal notifications

tions, any authoritative order, guidelines or administrative orders, or any orders, 

resolutions or decisions of court or other authoritative bodies, such changes 

shall not constitute a breach of this Whitepaper or the coin purchase terms and 

conditions.

6.4. Taxes

Value-added tax

The current opinion of Korean tax authorities is that cryptocurrencies are not 

subject to value-added tax when used as currencies, but are subject to val-

ue-added tax when traded as goods.  In this regard, the specific situations under 

which the tax authorities will consider cryptocurrencies as either currencies or 

goods are so far unclear.  However, once cryptocurrencies start to be traded on 

exchange platforms, it is considered to be highly likely that cryptocurrencies will 

be deemed as goods.  Therefore, except for cases where an individual, not a busi-

ness operator, purchases cryptocurrencies on the exchange market on a 

one-time basis without any business purpose, (although it is not clear whether or 

not value-added tax will be imposed on transactions in the exchange market 

conducted by individual residents, individual non-residents, Korean and foreign 

companies with business purposes) business (tax) registration, bearing of val-

ue-added tax, and/or issuance of tax invoices may be required in the future.

Income tax and corporate tax

If an individual who is a resident and a business operator engages in the pur-

chase and sales of cryptocurrencies, profits associated with such purchase and 

sales of cryptocurrencies may be subject to income tax.  However, if an individual 

who is not a business operator enjoys profit from any purchase and sales of 

ico_En.ai   26   2017-09-06   �� 10:14:55



6. Legal notifications

cryptocurrencies, it is unclear whether such profit is subject to capital gains tax.  

For profits earned by Korean companies for any purchase and sales of cryptocur-

rencies on the exchange market, corporate tax will be imposed.  Although it is un-

clear whether or not Korean tax will be imposed on profits generated by non-resi-

dents and foreign companies without an office in Korea for any purchase and 

sales of cryptocurrencies on the exchange market, such profits may be deemed 

as profits associated with assets within Korea, and thus be taxed.

6.5. Controlling Language

In case of any difference, discrepancy  or conflict between the Korean version of
