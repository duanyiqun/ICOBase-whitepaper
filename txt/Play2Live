INTRODUCTION 

Video games and eSports markets, representing the largest part of the global gaming 
industry, have started to attract the attention not only of their core audience (gamers), 
but also of crypto community. The global market for video games has already 
surpassed that of the film industry, topping $105 bn in 2017. This should not be 
surprising given that the funds required to develop and release a video game is often 
on a par with the budget of a Hollywood blockbuster.

At the same time, the tremendous growth of cryptocurrencies and dissemination of 
blockchain technology suggests that there are opportunities to unite eSports 
entertainment with a blockchain-based solution. This would address a number of 
inefficiencies and offer unique advantages over conventional streaming platforms, 
whose features have remained virtually unchanged over time.

To date, more than 30 gaming industry projects have been launched that make use of 
blockchain technology, which is just a fraction of the vast number of token sales being 
launched daily, a figure which now exceeds 300 a month. It is evident that there is a 
gap in the market for a project that can unite blockchain with the gaming industry to 
create a solution that benefits all parties. Play2Live has the potential to become a 
trailblazer in this emerging market and to establish a major presence before other 
enterprises emerge in the space.

PLAY2LIVE 
THE FIRST FULL-BLOWN DECENTRALIZED STREAMING PLATFORM FOR 

GAMERS AND ESPORTS FANS 

Based upon blockchain technology, Play2Live introduces a unique mixture of interactive 
features and monetizing tools, currently unavailable on existing streaming platforms. The 

further development of Play2Live’s Level Up Chain on the basis of Graphene fork allows to 
create the ultimate end-to-end solution for streamers, gamers and eSports fans covering all 
their needs, and also providing the key advantages of blockchain technology such as speed, 

transparency and availability.



The eSports market is valued at $700M for 2017 and is growing rapidly, with huge 
numbers of tournament views stemming from broadcasts by the most popular 
streamers. These numbers already exceed those of the world’s most popular sports 
events such as NBA and MLB. Traditional sports clubs such as FC Barcelona, 
Manchester United and Galatasaray have been swift to recognize the potential of 
eSports and have already acquired a number of eSports teams. Twitch.tv and 
YouTube Gaming are two of the highest profile streaming platforms to have emerged 
dedicated to the eSports and video games markets, with the former sold for $970M to 
Amazon less than four years ago.

With extensive experience of the eSports industry and a deep understanding of 
blockchain technologies and their potential, we have decided to focus on building a 
full-blown ecosystem for gamers. Play2Live streaming platform has been created on 
the basis of decentralization principles. One of its unique functions is the ability for 
any participant to influence the content generation process within the platform that 
allows to personally impact all stages of content generation. In other words, not only 
can the spectator watch the stream, but they can also act as a content creators. On 
top of that, any participant of the ecosystem has an opportunity to earn rewards. That 
approach is the antithesis of that offered by existing streaming platforms, where the 
viewer is obligated to spend funds on various activities and where their role in content 
creation is constrained or non-existent.

Play2Live token sale is expected to attract the seed user base of the project, which 
constitutes the critical mass of users required to get the platform up and running. The 
growth of the user base is facilitated by a streaming service featuring video 
broadcasts of gaming and eSports content, which is the core function of Play2Live. 
Implementation of blockchain technology allows to attract content and service 
providers with an access to the user base.

The number of cryptocurrency users in the world is still relatively low (tentatively 
100M cryptocurrency wallets), while the monthly audience of Twitch.tv is 100M unique 
users. It is conceivable that at least 10% of these users become cryptocurrency 
holders. Gamers are regarded as the most tech-savvy segment of PC and mobile 
users, and it is plausible to assume that they will find it easy to make the transition 
from fiat money to cryptocurrency, as many already have.

A primary concern when creating an ecosystem for gamers using blockchain 
technology is setting up an internal economy similar to the way countries issue money 
that is pegged to the value created by their residents. Similarly, blockchain systems 
issue cryptocurrency, which is pegged to the value of the businesses built around 
these systems and the belief of holders in its growth. At Play2Live, our goal is to build 
a full-blown ecosystem for all gamers and eSports fans that allowing any third-party 
projects and developers to freely integrate with the platform via API.

ACCORDING TO FORECASTS, THE REVENUE OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY 
WILL REACH $115 BILLION BY 2018 
AND BY 2020 WILL REACH THE $130 BILLION MARK.



The following excerpts are from a SuperData study:

665M people around the world tune in to sites like Twitch.tv and YouTube for 
content about their favorite games. Taking into account the 100M+ monthly active 
users of Twitch.tv and the total live broadcast, this audience is substantial. At the 
same time, data from the Chinese market are not included in the calculation, 
which significantly exceeds other regions in terms of viewership.

eSports is one of the fastest growing tech markets, with only VR technology 
market outpacing it.

ESPORTS MARKET

eSports is one of the most dynamically developing segments of the gaming industry. 
By 2020, the market is expected to reach $1.5 billion.

According to SuperData, live game content and VOD in 2017 will generate $4.6 
billion in revenue.

Twitch was acquired by Amazon for $970M and at present is the industry leader.

Gaming and eSports streaming markets have huge growth potential. Interestingly, 
Twitch.tv has been a market leader in both gaming and eSports sectors, accounting 
for 70% to 80% of the global gaming market share according to various estimates.

An in-depth market review of the gaming and eSports markets can be found in a 
separate document (Market Overview) that also contains an overview of the following 
markets:

user registered in the system has a cryptocurrency wallet powered by Level Up Coin 
(LUC) token, the fuel that facilitates monetization opportunities for all users, from 
streamers to viewers.

Play2Live introduces the brand-new streaming platform for 
gamers with several functional modules that provide users 
with a completely new level of virtual interaction. Diversified 
functionality of Play2Live platform is a significant 
advantage for the developing markets it operates in.

SETTING THE SCENE 

The emergence of platforms such as Twitch.tv has opened up a new market of live 
broadcasting and given a huge impetus to the development of the eSports industry. 
The data on gaming and eSports markets compared to that of traditional sports 
markets outlined in the previous sections indicate that in the foreseeable future, 
people will watch more eSports broadcasts than traditional sports events.

Despite the substantial growth of eSports, streaming platforms have scarcely 
changed in the last five years, with little in the way of innovation to enhance 
interaction between users and a streamer.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �11 72

PLAY2LIVE PLATFORM PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE 
SOLUTION FOR STREAMERS AND VIEWERS, ELIMINATING THE 
FOLLOWING WEAKNESSES OF EXISTING STREAMING 
PLATFORMS:

1. Limited opportunities for users and 
streamers to interact and no personalization options.

2. Restriction of users in the ability to earn from their hobbies.

3. Advertising is persistent and usually there is no option to disable it. The users 
are frustrated with the advertising and try to avoid it in any possible way.

4. Every user who wishes to stream their game and earn from this action cannot 
do it on a regular basis, while they expect to start earning money just after the 
registration in the system and wish to have more tools to monetize their 
streams better.



USERS OF STREAMING PLATFORMS EXPECT A GREATER LEVEL OF 
INTERACTION AND PERSONALIZATION

At the current stage of video game and eSports market development, fueled by the 
emergence of platforms such as Twitch.tv, it has become obvious that gamers can 
and wish to be more than mere viewers.

The amount of money gamers spend on donations to their favorite streamers equates 
to hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The primary motivation for such donations 
is to attract the attention of a favorite streamer and to support them.

There is clearly a use case for a platform similar to Twitch.tv that can offer viewers a 
new level of interactivity. Play2Live is the full-blown platform of such scale, facilitating 
numerous ways of interaction between a streamer and a viewer including a bilateral 
system of tasks, enhanced content generation process and many others. Compared 
to the simplistic chat communication and donation options provided by the existing 
platforms, it is a real step forward in terms of interaction. Play2Live opens possibilities 
for monetizing the streamers’ content, which leads to a better quality of entertainment 
and interaction for users.

USERS DO NOT WANT TO JUST BE OBSERVERS - THEY WANT TO EARN FROM 
THEIR HOBBY

Existing streaming platforms leave a user obligated to spend money on certain 
activities within the platform. These platforms also profit from advertising placements, 
which are often displayed to the irrelevant audience. In some regions, the use of ads 
blocking software is estimated to reach 80%.

Introduction of an opportunity to earn from watching advertising is expected to lower 
that percentage as well as increase the loyalty of the users. 

USERS WANT TO INDEPENDENTLY SELECT/CREATE CONTENT ON THE 
PLATFORM

Passive watching of streams or tournaments is no longer interesting. A good example 
is the amount of fees from ticket sales at The International Dota 2 championship, 
where 25% of the viewers watched the championship in Spectators Mode via the 
game client (Valve total revenue was $100m and EBITDA reached $70m). In other 
words, users were the creators of the stream. 
 
There is clearly a case for providing gamers and eSports fans with a tool that enables 
them not only to donate, but also to construct the content they wish to see. This next 
level of interaction includes the possibility to choose the board of commentators, 
decide on the outcome of the match and much more.

USERS ESCHEW ADVERTISING 

The proliferation of ads blocking tools on platforms similar to Twitch.tv is extremely 
high. Gamers are frustrated with the advertising and try to avoid it in any way – thus, it 
is time for the new solution allowing users to choose the way of watching 
advertisement. 

CRYPTOCURRENCIES NEED ACCESS TO THE MASS MARKET 

Due to the emerging status of of eSports and the light regulatory environment, which 
mirrors that of cryptocurrencies, there is an opportunity for gamers and 
cryptocurrency holders to establish an interactive entertainment market. Once 
Play2Live platform is established, it is expected that an influx of users will serve to 
increase the number of cryptocurrency adopters.

STREAMERS WANT TO START EARNING INSTANTLY

Streamers do not have to wait to accrue a certain number of streamed hours and 
impressions to start monetizing their actions – they can start earning from their first 
stream. Streamers also want to be able to instantly withdraw and spend money they 
had earned without filling out application forms and submitting proof of ID.

Obviously, streamers would marvel at the opportunity to monetize their hobby in 
diverse ways.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEM-SOLVING 
PHILOSOPHY 

Play2Live team combine years of experience working with such streaming platforms 
as Twitch.tv, Azubu.tv, Hitbox.tv, Boom.tv and Youtube Gaming. Play2Live platform 
boasts a significantly higher level of interactivity due to the use of blockchain. Our 
solution changes the rules of the game in the streaming market, giving the opportunity 
to earn not only for a streamer, but also for a viewer.

PLAY2LIVE PLATFORM INTRODUCES THE FULL-
BLOWN ECOSYSTEM FOR ESPORTS AND GAMING 
WITH DEEP FOCUS ON CONTENT GENERATION AND 
PRACTICAL NEEDS OF THE STREAMERS, WHILE 
MOST OF CRYPTO PROJECTS IN ESPORTS AND 
GAMING ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NARROW 
SOLUTIONS RESOLVING SOME MOMENTARY 
ISSUES OF CURRENT STATE OF ESPORTS MARKET. 

THUS, PLAY2LIVE DOES NOT COMPETE WITH MOST 
OF EXISTING CRYPTO PROJECTS IN ESPORTS AND 
GAMING. ON THE OTHER HAND, PLAY2LIVE IS ABLE 
TO ADD NEW PRODUCTS AND PARTNERS INTO THE 
ECOSYSTEM, AND OFFER THEM THE ABILITY TO 
INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE USERS OF LEVEL UP 
CHAIN.



The philosophy of Play2Live hinges on the principles of freedom and scaling 
interaction between viewers and streamers with the aid of blockchain technology. The 
economic model of the platform is one that empowers streamers and users to 
determine the type of content, the way it is displayed and, most importantly, its 
monetization type. 

�

The main functions of Play2Live platform are the implementation and maintenance of 
technical functionality along with other areas of participation. The interaction of 
streamers and users is direct and transparent due to the use of blockchain 
technology. The DPoS consensus algorithm allows this to be implemented in the 
platform, the application of which is elaborated on in the section devoted to the 
economic model.

Effectively, all users of the platform incur costs (for example, streamers can purchase 
promotion in the ratings on the main page, users pay for premium subscription etc.), 
but at the same time everyone can earn LUC including the viewers. 

INTERACTION ON PLAY2LIVE PLATFORM

Play2Live team have been able to design and develop a cutting-edge system of 
interaction between viewers and streamers thanks to the technology that the 
blockchain provides. This includes:

Advanced system of tasks, from viewers to streamers

Betting system carried out while watching eSports tournaments

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �15 72



By voting on Play2Live platform with LUC tokens, any user can set the price for 
performing a specific task for their favorite streamers. Examples include challenging 
the streamer to complete the game on the hardest difficulty level, to keep streaming 
for five hours or to start a stream on a different game etc. Any other user can support 
the tasks with LUC or assign their own task. A streamer can perform all tasks and 
receive all tokens or perform some of them and receive less. Likewise, users can bet 
on their favorite team with LUC in real time on the streaming platform while watching 
tournaments.

The consensus on performing tasks and confirmation of a streamer's actions is 
carried out by collective voting during the course of the stream broadcast. Most 
actively involved users receive rewards in LUC. This allows for gamification of the 
entire platform; the more actively users participate in various activities, the more 
tokens they earn.

More information about this and other features can be found in the section devoted to 
key features of the platform.

EARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLATFORM USERS

For the first time a streaming platform allows not only streamers to earn, but also 
viewers.

In particular, users are able to earn from:

Advertising: For each impression shown a certain number of tokens is 
transferred to the user

Voting and other kinds of contribution on the platform: the provision of consensus 
on certain actions is encouraged via various rewards

Sharing its internet channel via P2P model allowing the streams to be broadcast 
to other users.

Performing tasks set by streamers

Betting and gambling: A user is able to place a bet and win LUC while watching 
an eSports tournament on the platform

We are determined to introduce more earning possibilities for viewers in the future.

The streamers are able to earn in 11 ways compared to 5 currently available for them 
at the existing streaming platforms.  

�  �
White Paper

It is vital to understand that the goal of Play2Live ecosystem is to create favorable 
conditions within the platform for streamers so that they would like to transfer their fan 
base from the existing streaming platforms, attracting a seed audience to the 
platform.

We plan to achieve this goal not only by implementing a set of new features, which 
would provide for increased earning opportunities for a streamer, but also by allowing 
them to edit the parameters of the economy (for example, allowing to choose 
subscription fees rates or percentage of revenue from advertising gone to viewers). In 
other words, we provide an opportunity to freely control numerous economic 
parameters that govern interaction between a streamer and a viewer. Thus, the 
steamer can fine-tune the parameters of the economy in the most suitable way for 
their audience. Play2Live platform acts as a technological backbone that facilitates 
their interaction thanks to Blockchain technology aimed to provide transparency and 
interactivity.

A CONSTRUCTOR OF ESPORTS CONTENT

The International championship mentioned previously is an example of direct 
involvement in construction of eSports content by users. The entire prize fund and 
costs of hosting of the World Championship for the game Dota 2 were covered by the 
purchase of internal virtual tickets, the fees from which amounted to $100 million. 
Different stages of collected fees resulted in various bonuses for players who were 
incentivized to help raise more money.

Imagine an arbitrary project within Play2Live platform providing an opportunity for 
users to vote with LUC tokens for the creation of content (show matches with well-
known eSports teams, eSports championships, fan shows and fan matches of 
eSports stars including the most popular streamers etc). The partners of the platform 
such as streamers and tournament operators then implement and endeavor to 
accomplish the requests. 

Conversely, tournament organizers who wish to create a new tournament format and 
broadcast it but lack sufficient funds can place their championship on Play2Live 
platform and collect the needed money. Play2Live would essentially serve as an 
eSports Kickstarter enabling interested parties to raise funds and broadcast the 
resulting action on the platform for the benefit of all contributors.

Users who have voted to implement certain types of content on the platform are able 
to decide on key metrics (format and timing, desired commentators and other 
parameters) and receive various benefits and perks during the broadcast thanks to 
the developed system of gamification. Play2Live provides a unique opportunity for 
broadcast organizers, streamers and tournament operators to place content 
according to the desires and interests of their target audience, maximizing the 
prospects of user engagement and retention.

ADVERTISING ON THE PLATFORM

Decisions regarding the display of advertising and its parameters (frequency, 
positioning during the broadcast, duration) are completely left to the discretion of the 
streamer.

The streamer may specify video ads with the ability for viewers to skip the content, to 
limit the maximum time of the commercial, to position videos at the beginning of the 
broadcast or during breaks only and compete for their viewers. At the same time, 
viewers understand that by watching the advertising they directly support their favorite 
streamer and the platform, which facilitates their entertainment.

Similar to Brave project with its Basic Attention Token, Play2Live hosts a mechanism 
for partial sharing of advertising revenue between platform users, which allows each 
individual to receive a portion of the revenue from advertising and to watch the most 
relevant and useful ads based on their preferences. This obviates the need for ad-
blocking software, for users have no obligation to watch advertising.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �18 72



Moreover, Play2Live can boast an advanced referral system of work with eSports 
publishers. They are be able to craft their marketing campaigns fine-tuning them 
according to the functionality offered by Play2Live. In turn, streamers are the ones 
who will implement these campaigns. 

LEVEL UP COIN - THE FUEL THAT POWERS THE PLATFORM

Gamers are a natural audience to adopt and benefit from the advantages that 
cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can offer. These include:

The ability to start earning as a streamer instantly, receiving LUC from the very 
first broadcasts. There is no need to pass a certain viewing threshold, fill out multi-
page forms to receive money, and endure a lengthy waiting period before funds 
are transferred to the streamer’s bank account.

Any coin received for viewing ads, won at the totalizator or purchased in any other 
way can be transferred, spent or exchanged for fiat currency or any other 
cryptocurrency thanks to a gateway/API, which will allow to make transactions 
between the users convenient.

Fast transactions and low fees.

In the future LUC is expected to be used not only within Play2Live ecosystem, but 
also in other projects created on the basis of Level Up Chain.

Free conversion of LUC to cryptocurrencies that may be provided by other gaming 

services

Users registered in Play2Live system automatically become holders of 
cryptocurrency, helping to further grow the crypto community.

PLAY2LIVE PRODUCT IS UNIQUE IN THE FOLLOWING 
ASPECTS:

1. A regular user is able to earn in 5 ways minimum which is a 
considerable advantage to conventional streaming platforms that 
have no embedded blockchain system. 

2. A streamer is able to earn in 11 ways versus 4-5 regular ones 
offered by the existing run-of-the-mill solutions.

3. The platform profits from 15 revenue streams compared to 5 that 
are available for traditional streaming platforms.



FEATURES OF PLAY2LIVE PLATFORM. THE FIRST 
PROJECT BASED ON LEVEL UP CHAIN 

Play2Live utilizes a number of technological solutions to implement all of the desired 
features. All transactions pertaining to Level Up Coin tokens are to be executed and 
confirmed via the Level Up Chain blockchain. In this section, we elaborate on some of 
the features of Play2Live platform in greater detail.

The platform is anticipated to ultimately host more than 25 functional modules for 
users, 15 of which could generate revenue for users and at the same time provide an 
opportunity to spend earned tokens within the platform. We favor the possibility of 
adding new functional modules in the development process as we plan to interact with 
the community at all stages of the project and to solicit the feedback of both 
streamers and viewers.

THE PLATFORM CROWDFUNDING SYSTEM

The general logic of this feature is depicted in the diagram.

�

A system of voting with LUC for streams is implemented on the platform.

As shown in the diagram, three platform users want to watch the showmatch of the 
Fnatic team versus the Astralis team. They participate in a newly-created section in 
the voting system where, similar to Dota 2 compendium, they purchase internal 
tickets for this championship that provides them with various benefits:

1. Privileged status in the broadcast

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �20 72



2. Special features in chat

3. An opportunity to claim an increased percentage of revenue from any advertising 
placed inside the championship

4. The ability to choose properties of the championship (location, commentators and 
others)

5. Additional bonuses within the platform

6. Special digital gifts from the organizers

7. Interactions with participating teams

In the course of voting (via donations) for a particular championship or other content, 
users are provided with an opportunity to construct the content according to their 
desires. For example, they can dictate the board of commentators, the format of the 
meeting and even the locations provided that a sufficient level of funds has been 
collected. Partners of Play2Live platform are in charge of the arrangement of these 
championships and other types of content.

Funds can be collected for a large number of events simultaneously. This could be 
one large annual championship or regular monthly and even weekly championships. 
Users can choose the format of events they want to support. The crowdfunding 
system caters not only for creating eSports content, but also for the streamers who 
lack the required funds to launch a broadcast.

P2L PLATFORM AS AN ESCROW SERVICE FOR ESPORTS 
TOURNAMENTS ORGANIZERS

�

�  �
White Paper

In eSports, problems often arise with the payment of prize funds in instances where 
the organizers arranging a championship delay payment or do not pay any at all. 

Play2Live platform solves this problem with the use of blockchain technology. 
Moreover, the tournament operator can receive additional funding for their 
championship, showmatch or any other streaming event if they launch the project on 
Play2Live. However, in cases where they desire additional means of audience 
incentivization, the platform will facilitate additional goals to be set according to the 
funds raised.

As an example, a tournament operator manages to collect $10,000 for running a 
championship but needs additional funding. He sends fiat money through the 
gateway/API to the platform and transfers it to the Operations fund. Next, he obtains 
an additional 10,000 LUC from the users of the platform. Afterwards, upon reaching a 
funding goal, the funds flow to the escrow system of Level Up Chain. Upon ending of 
the championship and confirmation (if required) of its results by users, the prize is 
distributed to the crypto wallets of users according to their contribution.

TOTALIZATOR FOR ESPORTS TOURNAMENTS

�

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �22 72



�

Play2Live platform broadcasts various eSports content allowing users to bet on the 
totalizator directly on the platform in live mode. 

1. Users have made bets on either team 1 or team 2.

2. In case of bets on the outcome of the whole match, they must be made prior to 
the start of the match. If the match is broadcast in live mode, bets are made in 
real time.

3. The platform charges a small commission for each bet made.

4. The result is confirmed by the tournament operator.

5. In our example, team 1 overtook team 2. The tokens were returned to the users 
who had bet on team 1 with less platform commission. These users also received 
tokens of the users who had bet on team 2 in proportion.

The mechanism for betting is also linked to the time of placement of live bets on 
actions during the match (for example which team made the first FirstBlood or 
Headshot.)

It is also possible to exchange in-game items for LUC tokens in order to place bets. 
This feature enhances the interactivity of the platform when viewing any eSports 
match.

DONATION SYSTEM

�

Play2Live offers a system of donations, inspired by the model that is used on existing 
platforms. Thanks to the deployment of this feature on the Level Up Chain blockchain, 
we are able to revamp the traditional donation system. The updated system has: 

Transparency for all participants for the purpose of honest fundraising

Streamer is able to order a dump of data on users who previously made donations 
and reward them at his discretion.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE BROADCASTS OF FAVORITE 
STREAMERS

The platform implements a feature for contributing to the broadcast of a streamer in 
real time. For example, users are able to "like" the broadcast of their favorite 
streamers, rate it and upvote it in the process, increasing its visibility on the platform. 
Coupled with other ways of contributing to broadcasts, it serves to reward users from 
the Daily Reward Pool which is built into the platform. Thus, users who actively 
contribute to the platform are rewarded in the form of LUC tokens

TASKS FOR THE STREAMERS

It is conceivable that this feature will be warmly welcomed by the users due to 
thoroughly-crafted logic of interaction on all layers of the platform as well as 
blockchain system with DPoS consensus mechanism.

1. Several users want to assign various tasks to their favorite streamer at once. In 
our example, 3 out of 5 users made their choices for Task 1.

2. The streamer decided to perform only the Task 1, which was voted for by the 
majority of the users (65 LUC were allocated). In fact, the user ‘purchases’ some 
action from the streamer since the system holds the coins of the user before the 
streamer actually finishes this task. Tokens are returned to the users who voted 
for tasks 2 and 3 in case streamer did not choose these tasks 

3. The streamer completed the task and confirmed its execution. According to the 
revenue sharing model, P2L platform received 25 LUC as revenue in the example 
and the streamer gained 40 LUC as a reward.

Picture below depicts how the streamers’ performance is confirmed by the users.

In the example below the figures are arbitrary and serve 
solely to demonstrate the mechanics of the tasks 
assignment. The resulting figures of the stakes of the 
revenue sharing model will be fixed with the release of a beta 
version of the platform. The stakes for the basic revenue 
sources will be fine-tuned according to the interests of the 
users. New features Play2Live intends to implement after 
consulting with lawyers, collecting user feedback and 
running tests will have stakes fine-tuned to cater for the 
users of the system.

1. Upon finishing task 1, the streamer confirms its execution.

2. Users on the stream (those who participated with tokens in the tasks and those 
who did not participate and just watched the stream) vote and confirm the action 
of the streamer. They receive a reward for their activity from the Daily Reward 
Pool of the platform and at the discretion of the streamer can allocate a pool of 
rewards from the collected funds, in our example 3.25 LUC.

3. In case 51% or more of the users in the votes pool confirm finishing of the task, 
the streamer receives a reward. If the streamer has not completed the task, the 
funds are returned to users and the streamer may be subject to penalties.

4. In case users deliberately placed faulty votes, an oracle is invited to settle the 
dispute, and if this fact is recognized by the oracle, users of the system will be 
penalized.

This example demonstrates how is collective actions of the users contribute to the 
interaction during the stream.

PEER 2 PEER CDN 

Deployment of P2P CDN service on the platform contributes to the cost optimization 
of Play2Live as existing streaming platforms rely on centralized solutions.

�

The users of the platform will be rewarded for sharing their internet channel via P2P 
network. Blockchain Level Up Chain allows to implement this decision and thus to 
lower the expenditures of the project.

Effectively, establishing a decentralized P2P CDN service will allow every user to earn 
LUC without the need to perform many actions merely by sharing a part of their 
computer resources with others.

�  �
White Paper

LEVEL UP CHAIN BLOCKCHAIN   

Level Up Chain is not a competitor to existing platforms. Rather, it is a decentralized 
suite of tools that can be used by these platforms jointly to bring value to the 
decentralized economy. Over time, as development of Level Up Chain ramps up, we 
expect to launch other gaming and eSports services to attract existing centralized 
market players.

�

We aim to develop a solution that is indistinguishable from that of the existing 
platforms in terms of user-friendliness. The project is deployed on the Graphene 
platform, third-generation software with cryptographic protection and sustainable 
decentralized data registry. Graphene can handle large amounts of data providing 
privacy and high speed of confirmation as well signature of transactions.

Use of Up Level Chain provides high security due to:

Decentralized storage

Level Up Chain utilizes a decentralized autonomous 
governance model. It forms a blockchain ecosystem for 
streaming and gaming projects, with Level Up Coin allowing 
for settlements within the system. Play2Live platform is the 
first project to launch, contributing to the network’s 
development and attracting streamers and viewers. The key 
goal is to establish a system that is transparent, user-
friendly and most importantly has value, providing a set of 
features for users that is beyond those offered by existing 
streaming platforms.

Immutable data records

Transaction anonymity at three stages (sender, transaction, recipient)

We are building an interaction system based on the delegated proof of stake (DPoS) 
consensus algorithm.

�
Development of the platform, selection of community members, witnesses and 
management team of Level Up Chain are determined by the holders of the underlying 
asset Level Up Coin, which is a standard for DPoS.

This solution allows streamers and viewers who hold large amounts of LUC to 
become witnesses and even members of the community, allowing to directly influence 
the performance of the project and future developments. An important advantage of 

WITNESSES confirm the transactions and ensure network 
security. A randomly selected witness every three seconds 
produces one block of data in the blockchain. Finalization 
occurs after confirmation of 2/3 of block producers. All 
blocks are confirmed by the witnesses and all witnesses 
store a full chain of blocks. 

MEMBERS of the community propose changes to the key 
parameters of the blockchain such as commission, time of 
block production and others. Members of the Community 
decide on the management team members and witnesses on 
behalf of the holders of Level Up Coin.  

THE MANAGEMENT TEAM performs operational 
management, development and maintenance of Level Up 
Chain.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �29 72



using such a consensus algorithm is that block producers  are not able to control the 
network due to the presence of witnesses and the community members.

Thanks to Graphene technology, we expect to reach a speed of transactions in Level 
Up Chain exceeding 50,000 TPS, which is hundreds of times faster than the Bitcoin 
and Ethereum networks. 

MAIN PARTICIPANTS OF PLAY2LIVE PLATFORM

THE PLATFORM serves as a ‘graphical wrapping’ around 
blockchain API, easing user interaction with blockchain and 
allowing for broadcasting of streams since the decentralized 
storage and broadcasting of such a huge amount of heavy 
content has proven economically infeasible. 

STREAMERS use platforms for broadcasting streams and for 
monetization of their and others’ time and attention. 
Interaction between viewers and streamers brings integrity 
and value to the platform.     

VIEWERS consume content, comment and vote for it. Daily 
rewards for viewers is dependent on the amount of their LUC 
and on the quality of their curation (whether they vote for 
popular streams, vote in accordance with the streamer's 
actions and perform other actions that require consensus by 
a general vote). For example, a user who has more LUC 
receives a greater reward at voting on the confirmation of a 
streamer’s actions. 

Viewers buy a LUC token to spend it in one of 15 ways, and 
also to receive more influence on the distribution of the 
reward pool and to obtain larger reward during voting and 
other activities on the platform. 

MODERATORS can also be selected by the voting system or 
otherwise in case a disputed situation cannot be resolved by 
voting.

DESIGN OF THE LUC TOKEN AND ITS APPLICATION 
WITHIN PLAY2LIVE PROJECT 

To better understand the interaction between all participants of the system and their 
mutual settlements in Level Up Chain, we will review the economy of the project. We 
anticipate that the economy model will be launched after the release of an open 
version of the project, in 3Q 2018.

In the example below, the figures are arbitrary and 
demonstrate the process of buying premium subscription on 
the streamer’s channel. The resulting figures in the revenue 
sharing model will be fixed following the release of a beta 
version of the platform. The stakes for the basic revenue 
sources will be fine-tuned according to the interests of the 
users. New features Play2Live intends to implement after 
consulting with lawyers, collecting user feedback and 
running tests will have stakes catered for the interests of 
the users of the system in the first place.

LEVEL UP COIN TOKEN PROVIDES THE 
MEANS OF PAYMENT INSIDE PLAY2LIVE 
PLATFORM. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN 
EASY CONVERSION MECHANISM OF 
OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR FIAT 
MONEY TO LUC VIA A GATEWAY/API.



Comments regarding the diagram:

1. STEP 1. The user of the platform has $5 (Visa/ MasterCard / PayPal / card of 
another fiat payment system) and wants to either pay for a service on the platform 
or interact with a streamer or make a contribution of any kind.

2. They send $5 to a gateway/API and immediately receive 100 LUC at the current 
weighted average market rate less a small gateway commission. The transaction 
takes place instantly due to the use of tokens from the Operations fund, where 
there is always a sufficient amount of tokens to enable transactions.

3. STEP 2. The external gateway through the gateway/API in turn may ‘borrowed’ 
100 LUC from the Operations funds and must return it back in full, or may buy 
tokens at open market once and if such tokens will be available for purchase. In 
this manner, a possible and reasonably expected increase of tokens’ demand is 
maintained within the platform.

4. To maintain technology process for using of the platform, after the tokens are 
bought at the open market, if any, a gateway/API returns them to the Operations 
funds.

5. STEP 3. After the user receives their 100 LUC, they can spend in any of 15 
available ways. Afterwards, LUC start to get distributed in the system.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �32 72



6. 80% of the tokens from gross revenue of the platform are eliminated (32 LUC). 
Further, 5% of the tokens (2 LUC) are reserved for the Daily Reward Pool and 5% 
are reserved to sustain Level Up Chain functioning (2 LUC). 10% of the revenue 
in tokens (4 LUC) flows to the Operations Fund, which can be used by the 
management team to enhance the platform and to roll out marketing activities. In 
total, 100% of Play2Live revenue (40 LUC) is distributed.

7. A streamer receives their amount of tokens – 60 LUC in this example.

8. The stake of LUC received by a streamer, a platform and a viewer (when 
applicable) is determined separately in each case dependent on the type of 
action.

The platform endeavors to motivate streamers to retain tokens within the platform via 
providing the following benefits:

Offering larger rewards due to DPoS.

Deploying spending mechanism within the system to promote their channels and 
purchase prizes for contests.

Allocating LUC to systems analogous to the Bancor protocol.

Thus, streamers in the system are interested in user loyalty 
and are not interested in violating the rules or deceiving 
other participants. Users likewise bring value to the system.

15 SOURCES OF REVENUE GENERATION WITHIN 
THE PLATFORM 

Play2Live introduces the following 15 key methods of revenue generation 
within the ecosystem utilizing LUC tokens:

1. SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE STREAMER’S CHANNEL

All users can watch any broadcast for free and with no limitations. But only those who 
subscribed to the channel are provided with additional privileges (the list is to be 
expanded):

In the event of a large number of viewers on the stream, the Subscribers Only 
mode can be enabled so that only those who had purchased a subscription can 
chat.

Subscribers can use exclusive emoticons and chat icons as well as other 
distinctive elements that are integrated into the platform.

Valuable prizes (mice, keyboards and other peripherals) are distributed in 
Subscribers Only mode during tournaments so that only users who had purchased 
a subscription can participate. There is also access to other exclusive features 
that the channel owner provides for subscribers.

The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue sharing model that has 
been agreed with the streamer.

2. DONATIONS

During the stream, users transfer tokens to the streamer to demonstrate support and 
also for the streamer to read out special messages from the viewers.

Special software can read out the messages prepared by users and a donations 
mechanism can be used to receive exclusive messages or any other rewards from 
the steamer as agreed by the parties.

The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue sharing model agreed with 
the streamer, with the majority going to the streamer and Play2Live charging a small 
commission.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �34 72



3. TOTALIZATOR OF ESPORTS EVENTS

During streams of eSports events that are broadcast on the platform, viewers are 
allowed to bet with LUC tokens on their favorite team before the start of the match, 
being able to compete against opponents of their team.

Bets are made in real time before the start of the event. In this way, users 
independently establish a betting coefficient. This model comprises a P2P system of 
bets that can be placed on the user’s favorite team where there is no third party such 
as a bookmaker involved. The platform charges a commission from every match in 
which the bets are placed.

4. ASSIGNING THE STREAMER A TASK

During the stream or prior to its beginning, viewers can assign tasks to the streamer 
(for example, to stream for five hours; to stream another game; to pass the game at a 
certain level of difficulty; to perform any other game or non-game action), voting with 
LUC.

The audience monitor the popularity of the tasks suggested by other users. The 
streamers then decide whether they perform one or more tasks and then proceed to 
enact them. The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue sharing model 
with the streamer.

5. TASKS FROM THE STREAMER TO USERS

Streamers can assign tasks to users, who perform them. The reward is distributed in 
the form of LUC tokens and the platform charges a small commission.

6. CREATING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM

Viewers can vote with tokens to create content which is then broadcast on the 
platform. The system presents a multi-level voting system (with LUC tokens), which is 
carried out in several stages. Rewards are distributed to users upon reaching different 
collection stages.

The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue sharing model with the 
tournament operator, which arranges the tournament according to the criteria 
suggested by the users, or with a streamer who makes a special show/content 
regarding the criteria specified by users at the time of voting.

White Paper
Page �  of �35 72



7. PROMOTION OF THE BROADCASTS OF A FAVORITE 
STREAMER

Viewers can vote with LUC to promote their favorite streamer so that they appear 
higher on the main page and in various categories. This revenue goes to Play2Live 
platform. However, out of the total volume of tokens purchased from the open market 
according to the economic model mechanism, a portion shall be distributed to users 
who actively vote with their tokens for promotion of the streamers. 

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �36 72



8. BETTING AND GAMBLING

Betting is an integral part of eSports. Play2Live publishes the coefficients from 
different bookmakers (which provide their API for integration into the platform and 
agree to accept LUC as a means of payment for these types of bets). Users can 
wager on several betting websites simultaneously while watching the stream 
broadcast without the need to actually visit these websites. After bets have been 
approved by bookmakers via API, users will be redirected to their websites. Bets are 
placed in LUC and earnings are formed according to the model of revenue sharing 
with bookmakers.

9. PURCHASING OF GAMES AT PARTNER SERVICES

This feature suggests an ability to purchase any games that are streamed on the 
platform in real time. The earnings are formed according to the revenue sharing 
model with entities that sell games and agree to receive LUC as a means of payment.

10. DUELS BETWEEN PLAYERS

Viewers can watch the stream and then challenge each other in the chat for any 
reason. A bet is placed the form of tokens. Affected by other viewers in the chat (a 
public call to action), another viewer can respond by accepting the bet. The platform 
redirects them to services like Firstblood.io where users play the game face to face. 
The earnings are formed according to the model for sharing the proceeds from bets 
placed with the partner service.

11. MARKETPLACE WITH PRIZES FROM ADVERTISERS

The platform receives prizes and gifts from advertisers who propose streamers to run 
marketing campaigns with certain coverage level. A marketplace is established within 
the platform where they can find marketing materials (prizes) to promote their 
channel. Play2Live receives prizes from advertisers free of charge. The streamers 
distribute prizes provided during their broadcasts. At the same time, streamers are 
obliged to provide a certain level of media coverage during their broadcasts to use 
prizes for channel promotion. 

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �37 72



12. PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTIONS

Premium subscriptions allow for several enhanced options such as receiving special 
gifts from the publishers or gaining access to exclusive broadcasts. Users with 
premium subscriptions are also denoted as such on the platform. The platform shares 
this revenue according to the revenue sharing model with the streamer.

13. ADVERTISING

Consistent with our philosophy, we have implemented the opportunity to fully enable/
disable advertising as well as other special features at the discretion of the viewer. 
The streamers in turn motivate users to enable it.

1. Pre Roll, Mid Roll, Post Roll advertising - the classic model of showing commercials 
before, in the middle or at the end of the broadcast. A streamer can place any number 
of commercials in their streams.

2. Banners are positioned in various places on the platform, allowing campaigns to 
run with classic CPA / CPM models as well as an option for branding the main page.

Play2Live features the referral system of work with publishers that will allow a 
streamer to run comprehensive marketing campaigns that will be suggested by the 
publishers with a transparent performance tracking system on all stages. 

The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue sharing model with the 
streamer.

14. SALE OF BADGES OF RANK ON THE PLATFORM

Emoticons, chat badges and other distinctive features for users are available in the 
chat during streams. The platform shares this revenue according to the revenue 
sharing model with a streamer.

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �38 72



15. P2P CDN

Due to the deployment of P2P CDN service on the platform, the content is distributed 
via the users’ PCs/laptops/gadgets allowing for a reduction in CDN maintenance 
costs that the platform accrues. The platform rewards these users in exchange for 
their contribution.

Therefore, deployment of a decentralized P2P CDN service allows every user to earn 
LUC at ease just by sharing a part of their computer resources with others compared 
to complexity of cryptocurrency mining.

The sections above describe 15 sources of revenue generation in detail, providing a 
demonstration of use cases for LUC tokens. Play2Live provides a new level of 
interactivity, leading to an influx of unique users to the platform, which may result to 
the possible demand on the tokens.

We fully understand that some users are not familiar or comfortable with 
cryptocurrency, and thus demand the option of paying for services and purchasing 
goods with fiat currency. 

For the ease of users unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, we have established gateway/
API for third party providers for purchasing LUC in a few clicks with credit/debit cards, 
e-wallets, banks transfers, and other popular fiat payment systems. The users are 
able to exchange popular cryptocurrencies for LUC through the gateway/API without 
the need to switch to the cryptocurrency exchange. 

Consistent with the forecasts on the number of platform users, each new user's 
registration on the platform reasonably results to the increase in the platform's 
demand by community that may in turn lead to possible increase of demand on the 
LUC inside the platform. In turn, Play2Live is obliged to eliminate 80% of P2L gross 
revenue, which is conceptualized in the economic model. 

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �39 72

IT IS HARD TO RECALL ANOTHER CRYPTO PROJECT THAT 
FEATURES WHOLE 15 WAYS OF TOKEN USAGE. IT IS PLAUSIBLE 
THAT ALIGNED WITH THE GROWTH OF SEED USERS ON THE 
PLATFORM, THIS WILL PROVIDE A POSSIBLE STIMULUS OF THE 
INCREASED DEMAND ON LUC.



MAU (Monthly active users) projections from the public release of Play2Live:

�

One of the key advantages of Play2Live is the constant influx of organic traffic to the 
platform which is often a struggle for B2C-oriented projects within the industry. This is 
why we have established a solid interaction scheme between the platform, streamers 
and users.

To be able to instantly process and transfer tokens to platform users, a special 
Operations funds will be created to provide a stable supply of LUC comprising a fixed 
percentage of the total supply of LUC. The tokens allocated to the Operations funds 
are stored in the blockchain until the release of the beta version of the platform.

In doing so, we plan to achieve another fundamental goal of the platform: increasing 
the total number of cryptocurrency holders in the world through the use of Level Up 
Chain. The concept is broadly similar to the logic behind SteemIT, where a 
cryptocurrency wallet is created with each registration in the system.

Up to 5% of the LUC gained as platform’s revenue is to be allocated to user rewards, 
to be distributed to individuals who:

Rate the content of streamers in various ways: by liking it, suggesting 
improvements, posting special comments etc

Vote on the validity of confirmation of the tasks performed by a streamer

Vote for creation of novel/unique content

Vote in other controversial or disputed situations

Make donations to streamers

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �40 72



Become moderators: when a certain LUC balance is reached, users are granted 
the status of a certified chat moderator and are able to moderate communication 
and receive remuneration for this with the approval of the channel owner. To 
obtain chat moderator status, the total amount of LUC received for task 
completion or as a reward during contests is counted. This encourages users to 
spend more time on the platform.

This is anticipated to create additional value within the project and will act as an 
incentive for token-holders to retain as many of LUC in the ecosystem as possible. 
We likewise plan to implement several solutions analogous to the Bancor protocol for 
platform users, which will also provide an incentive to retain tokens. Likewise, after 
the projects reaches break-even point, the project team can use the funds stored in 
the Operation fund at their own discretion to enhance the platform and to roll out 
marketing activities.

Following the investment stage and the anticipated rapid growth of the project, the 
funds received during the token sale will be spent on the development of the platform 
and Level Up Chain Foundation along with other initiatives. With the development of 
blockchain technology and greater penetration of cryptocurrency, we foresee that 
some costs of the project can be incurred in LUC and reduced thanks to the 
development of decentralization technologies. Such technologies include:

Development of decentralized CDN which leads to cutting one of the largest costs 
- payments for the delivery of content to the end user.

Further development of the decentralized advertising market.

Reduction of the cost of heavy content storage (VOD records) due to the 
emergence of a large number of decentralized cloud services.

Transcoding technologies thanks to improved computer performance.

These and other technologies might contribute to the creation of a high-grade internal 
economy to further fuel the project.

After reaching the breakeven point, we anticipate that we will 
eliminate 25% of the tokens from the project’s profits. According 
to our expectations, breakeven point will be reached at the 
beginning of the second year after the public launch of the 
project.

PLAY2LIVE TOKEN SALE SPECIFICS AND LEVEL UP COIN 
TOKEN FEATURES

The table below depicts the anticipated distribution of LUC tokens. A maximum of 
1,308,800,000 ERC20-compliant tokens can be created to be distributed in the course 
of the token sale after sending the funds to the valid smart-contract address. Tokens 
that are not distributed during the token sale will not be created and the additional 
emission of LUC tokens will not be initiated. The resulting amount of tokens issued 
will be announced upon the end of the token sale. The distribution of token sale 
proceedings presented below applies to any amount of collected funds 
regardless of its size.

The ERC20-compatible token Level Up Coin will be distributed during the token sale. 
Following the release of Level Up Chain, Play2Live anticipates exchanging Level Up 
Coin for Level Up Chain tokens at the rate of 1 to 1.

The funds allocated to the Operations funds of the project will be locked in the smart-
contract and thus will not be used until the release of the MVP.

The funds stored in the Operations funds will be locked up for two years since the 
beta version public release. The funds of the project team and the founders will be 
vested during 2 years. The funds of the project partners will be vested during 3 years.

The distribution of proceeds from token sale is depicted on the graph.

�

The logic underpinning the distribution of token sale proceeds suggests 
understanding the business processes of the current market of streaming and its 
realities in terms of costs.

A large amount of money is required to receive the broadcasting rights of eSports 
content and to negotiate contracts with the top streamers, which is crucial for 
bringing organic traffic to the platform. Our goal in the first year after the launch is 
to generate a steady inflow of streamers to the platform, who will attract a seed 
user base. This is possible at the initial stage solely due to acquiring rights to 
broadcast top eSports events, as well as signing exclusive contracts with popular 
streamers.

Token sale budget distribution

Purchasing the right to broadcast esports tournaments 20 %

Negotiating exclsuive broadcasting contracts with streamers 15 %

Marketing 10 %

Play2Live platform development 10 %

Blockchain (Level Up Chain) development 3 %

Legal fees 3 %

Personnel expenses and other OPEX 8 %

Administration and project team 10 %

Outsourcing 3 %

CDN and maintanance fees 18 %

* - grows proportionally to the increase of traffic to the Platform

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �58 72



Marketing will play significant role, including the support we will provide to our first 
streamers and tournament organizers who will migrate to the platform.

A significant part of the proceeds will be spent on payment for CDN service 
because unlike most decentralized projects, Play2Live broadcasts live video 
content in high quality and its streaming costs are significantly higher than that of 
an average web service.

The financial roadmap is tied to the development of certain features on the platform 
and to the opportunity to purchase the rights to broadcast eSports tournaments and 
show matches, as well as opportunities to sign exclusive contracts with the most 
famous streamers at the initial stage.

SUMMARY 

This white paper has elaborated on the bottlenecks persistent in the gaming industry 
and described a whole new set of features for users that no gaming platform or 
project can currently offer.

Consistent with the philosophy of our project, we are determined to provide users and 
streamers with a solution where they can easily create novel content and interact on 
the principles and terms instilled within the system. Play2Live platform is a full-blown 
participant of the system, though its role shall be narrowed to maintenance and 
providing safety. In turn, Level Up Chain is an open source project that allows third 
party projects to be launched on its blockchain to make use of its technical 
capabilities.

In the sections devoted to the economy of the token and the features of the platform, 
we described in detail how users and streamers interact within the ecosystem. If 
existing market players were to endeavor to implement the same features in their 
platforms they would encounter difficulties due to the following reasons:

The application of blockchain technologies to the existing architecture of any high-
load project is a truly complex and expensive solution. Its architects need to 
consider a myriad of factors, which will postpone the implementation of such 
technology for at least a few years.

Due to the advent of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies are usually 
introduced, representing a complex and long-term political and economic decision 
for large corporations to make.

The introduction of cryptocurrency and subsequent change in the company's 
business with vague economic effects on reports (P&L, cash flow statement and 
balance sheet) will discourage management from making the switch to a 
blockchain model and will also deter existing users of the platform.

A number of features such as integration of bookmaker APIs and use of a 
totalizator is easier to implement for young projects largely due to the current 
underdeveloped legal framework in the field of cryptocurrencies.

White Paper
Page �  of �62 72



Summing up above points, we are establishing a full-blown 
ecosystem  advantageous to the existing streaming 
platforms, namely in the following dimensions: 

1. Play2Live provides an opportunity for a streamer to earn LUC from 
the very first stream. Overall, streamers are able to earn in 11 
ways. 

2. We allow for the viewers to earn from their hobby minimum in 5 
ways, which is currently not available in existing streaming 
platforms. 

3. These facts contribute to the growth of the platform due to 15 
sources of revenue generation. To recap, conventional streaming 
platforms can boast only 5 of such sources. Effectively, this serves 
as an exemplary proof of the possible demand on the tokens which 
can be used in 15 ways on the platform. It has been available due to 
the deployment of top-notch blockchain system. 

4. Streamers are able to determine numerous aspects of interaction 
with viewers directly without the involvement of any third-party. 

5. One of the unique selling points of the projects is an ability for a 
user to fully disable advertising at no cost. The users are be able 
to enable it in case they desire to support their favorite streamer 
at the same time being able to earn from it. 

6. A unique content generation system allows to directly engage 
users in its creation. 

7. Owing to the ability for the streamers and viewers to interact 
directly on the basis of blockchain system, we are able to 
implement many features such as an interactive system of tasks 
for a streamer and others. 

8. A possible demand in the open market on LUC tokens should 
favorably affect the whole project economy. 

9. Level Up Chain blockchain is established to encompass an 
unlimited number of eSports and gaming projects as well as to 
support Play2Live performance, which is likely to contribute to the 
overall growth of the active userbase of all projects. 

10.The project is initiated by an expertized team from gaming and 
eSports industries with experience of key project representatives 
exceeding 10 years each.

Certain Risk Factors Relating to Purchase, Sale, and Use of Tokens  

IMPORTANT NOTE:.THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE 
OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM: (I) 
RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS EXHIBIT D, (II) ANY 
ERROR, OMISSION OR INACCURACY IN ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR (III) ANY 
ACTION RESULTING FROM SUCH INFORMATION. 

By purchasing, owning, and using Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and 
assume the following risks: 

1. General Suitability of Token Purchase

The purchase of tokens from the Company is only suitable for financially 
sophisticated persons who are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such a 
purchase, or other persons who have been professionally advised with regard to 
token purchase, and who have sufficient financial resources to be able to bear any 
losses that may arise therefrom (which may be equal to the whole amount spent in 
connection with the token purchase). Such a purchase should not be seen as an 
investment or a financial asset. 

2. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial 
Error or Purchaser Error 

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose 
of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private 
key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of 
such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), 
including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, 
may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or 
otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store 
Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or 
vault, may also result in the loss of you Tokens. Additionally, your failure to follow 
precisely the procedures set forth for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for 
instance, if you provide the wrong address for the Purchaser Address, or provides an 
address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens. 

3. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol 

Because Tokens and the Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any 
malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a 
material adverse effect on the Platform or Tokens. Moreover, advances in 

�  �
White Paper
Page �  of �66 72



cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum 
computing, could present risks to the Tokens and the Platform, including the utility of 
the Tokens for obtaining Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic 
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. 

4. Risk of Mining Attacks 

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, 
the Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token 
transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend 
attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful 
attacks present a risk to the Platform and the Tokens, including, but not limited to, 
accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens. 

5. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses 

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the 
Platform or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware 
attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing 
and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Platform is based on open-source software, 
there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally 
or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Platform, 
which could negatively affect the Platform and the Tokens, including the utility of the 
Tokens for obtaining Services. Hackers or other malicious groups of organizations 
may also attempt to get access to private keys or other access credentials in the 
Wallet or any other wallet, vault, or other storage mechanism used to receive and 
hold Tokens. As the result, the Tokens may be lost forever.

6. Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens 

The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Platform, and Company will not 
support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. 
This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt 
of Services, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to the Tokens you 
own. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such 
exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, 
making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent 
that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as 
denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and 
diminish to zero. 

7. Risk of Uninsured Losses 

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are 
uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in 
the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal

Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer 
recourse to you. 

8. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions 

The regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or 
unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory 
agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its 
applications, including the Platform and the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict 
how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law 
and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including 
the Platform and the Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the 
Platform and the Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, 
through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of the Tokens 
constitutes unlawful activity or that the Tokens are a regulated instrument that require 
registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in 
the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. Company may cease operations in a 
jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make 
it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the 
necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. 

9. Risks Arising from Taxation 

The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice 
in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax 
consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting 
requirements.  In addition, the proceeds of the Token sale (which include any 
moneys that purchaser has paid for the Tokens) may be taxable to the Company, 
which may adversely affect financial resources available to the Company, 
Company’s business and the Company's ability to achieve its business objectives.

10. Risk of Competing Platforms 

It is possible that alternative Platforms could be established that utilize the same 
open source code and protocol underlying the Platform and attempt to facilitate 
services that are materially similar to the Services. The Platform may compete with 
these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Platform and Tokens, including 
the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 

11. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform or Distributed Applications 

It is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, 
companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the 
creation and development of distributed Platforms (such as the Platform) more 
generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of 
the Platform and therefore the potential utility of the Tokens, including the utility of

Page �  of �68 72



the Tokens for obtaining Services. 

12. Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Platform 

The Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over 
time. Although Company intends for the Tokens and Platform to function as 
described in Exhibit C, and intends to take commercially reasonable steps toward 
those ends, Company may have to make changes to the specifications of the Tokens 
or Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. Moreover, Company has no control 
over how other participants will use the Platform, what products or services will be 
offered through the Platform by third parties, or how third-party products and 
services will utilize Tokens (if at all). This could create the risk that the Tokens or 
Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at 
the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite Company’s good faith efforts to develop 
and participate in the Platform, it is still possible that the Platform will experience 
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may 
negatively impact the Platform and Tokens, and the potential utility of the Tokens, 
including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 

13. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of ETH, BTC or Other Coin Value  
If the value of ETH, BTC or other coins fluctuates unfavorably during or after the 
Token sale, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be 
able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it intended. In addition to 
the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could exacerbate 
the risk of unfavorable fluctuation in the value of ETH, BTC or other coins, including 
another DAO-like attack on the Ethereum network, or significant security incidents or 
market irregularities at one or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. 

14. Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Platform 

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an 
unfavorable fluctuation in the value of ETH, BTC or ICOCOIN (or other cryptographic 
and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility (including their utility for obtaining 
Services), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership 
challenges, the Platform may no longer be viable to operate or the Company may 
dissolve. 

15. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights 

Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform 
or the Company, all decisions involving the Company’s products or services within 
the Platform or the Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole 
discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or 
services in the Platform, to create and sell more Tokens for use in the Platform, or to 
sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Platform 
and the utility of any Tokens you own, including their utility for obtaining Services.

16. Regulatory Risks

The Company, and by extension the Platform, is subject to a variety of federal, state 
and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to privacy and 
data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and 
regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could 
change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Platform could be enacted, 
which could impact the utility of the Tokens in the Platform. Additionally, the Platform 
participants are subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing 
requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing 
requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations 
or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could 
adversely impact the Platform and the Tokens, including the Tokens’ utility for 
obtaining Services. 

Also, changes in laws or regulations governing the Company's operations may 
adversely affect its business. Any change in the Company's tax status, or in taxation 
legislation in the United States or elsewhere, could affect the value of its financial 
holdings, its business and the Company's ability to achieve its business objective. 
Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers with respect to their 
particular tax situations and the tax effects of the purchase of Tokens from the 
Company.

17. Operational Risks 

The Company is a young company and the growth of the team and its capabilities 
may take longer than expected to result in the intended usefulness for the Tokens. 
The Tokens are just one product in a highly competitive market, and broad adoption 
by other users and developments by technology partners may take longer than 
expected. The usefulness of the Tokens depends on the extent of widespread 
adoption of the offered technology by the marketplace. 

18. Risk of Lack of Adoption

The success of the Platform, Services, and Tokens is dependent in large part to the 
adoption of the Platform, Services, and underlying technology by users. It is possible 
that users do not adopt or use the Platform. Such lack of use or interest could 
negatively impact the development of the Platform and therefore the potential utility 
of the Tokens, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 

19. Technology Risks 

The Tokens are intended to represent a new capability on emerging technology that 
is not fully proven in use. As the technology matures, new capabilities may 
dramatically alter the usefulness of the Tokens or the ability to use or sell them. The 
functionality of the Tokens is complex, will require enhancements and product 

�  �

Page �  of �70 72



support over time, and full functionality may take longer than expected. The full 
functionality of the Tokens is not yet complete and no assurance can be provided of 
such completion. 

20. Unanticipated Risks 

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. In 
addition to the risks included in this Exhibit D there are other risks associated with 
your purchase, possession, and use of the Tokens, including unanticipated risks. 
Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the 
risks discussed in this Exhibit D.

21. Forward Looking Statements

The Company’s Token sale whitepaper and the documents attached thereto or 
associated wherewith contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which are 
subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995.  These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements 
regarding anticipated use of proceeds from the Token sale, are based on current 
expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, Company management’s 
beliefs, and assumptions made by Company management. Words such as 
“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and 
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future 
performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are 
difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those 
expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of 
factors, including, without limitation, our ability to meet the minimum Token sale 
amount, if any, unanticipated costs and expenses related to the Token sale, changes 
in Company’s financial condition or business strategy that impact the use of 
proceeds from the Token sale, and other factors.  The risks and uncertainties include 
those noted in “Risk Factors” above.  Undue reliance should not be placed on the 
forward-looking statements in this whitepaper or any associated materials, which are 
based on information available to us on the date hereof.   We undertake no
