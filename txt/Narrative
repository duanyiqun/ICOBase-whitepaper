INTRODUCTION 

It’s time for content creators to get rewarded for their hard work. Narrative is a 
self-sustaining content ecosystem where members are in charge, users get paid, 
and the world’s best content, on every subject imaginable, is easy to find. 

Narrative is a Content Economy, 
generating rewards for content 
creators, moderators, and others who 
positively contribute to the quality of 
content on the network. 
 
Narrative is autonomous, transparent, 
and completely user-centric.  
Reputation scores and content ratings 
ensure that “bad eggs” have minimal 
impact and that quality users and 
content rise to the top (and are 
rewarded the most). 

The economic motive for Narrative 
is to reward all users who add value 
to the network.  

Narrative is the world’s public journal.  
There are three types of content 
channels on Narrative: Personal 
Journals, Niches (subject-based 
collections), and Brands. 

Users can follow specific Narrative 
channels and view a stream of all 
content they track. All content is 
public, curated and managed by  
elected moderators. 

Best of all, 85% of all revenues 
generated by the network flow 
directly to the active participants (e.g., 
content creators, active participants, 
moderators, and other positive 
influencers). 

The Narrative organization 
(“Organization”) manages the  
software development, technical 
infrastructure and product marketing, 
but has no role in moderating users or 
content. 

All revenue for the network is logged 
and managed using blockchain 
technology to ensure immutability 
and transparency, but the network 
itself may include off-chain functions 
to ensure outstanding performance 
and powerful search capabilities. 

Narrative makes visible all actions by 
moderators and leaders, so that the 
community as a whole can ensure it is 
properly represented.  

It’s great content, by the people, for 
the people.

E·CON·O·MY 
/ƏˈKÄNƏMĒ/ 
“An entire network of producers, distributors, and consumers of goods and 
services in a local, regional, or national community.”1 

As the first true Content Economy, 
Narrative disrupts the traditional 
business model for social media 
networks.   

For current social networks, there is 
no economy; there is only 
subjugation.  The producers and 
consumers of content on traditional 
social networks do all of the work and 
realize none of the income.  The 
economic motive for the corporation 
running the network is to increase 
profits through the sale of advertising. 

Users have no control over whether 
their personal data is shared with third 
parties, no input on editorial 
decisions, and their content can be 
censored at any time for any reason 
by a monolithic corporation that calls 
all of the shots.  They have no seat at 
the table, and in fact their sole role is 
to keep generating content so the 
corporation can sell more ads. 

With Narrative, however, the 
participants in the network engage 
symbiotically toward the common 
goal of creating and maintaining a 
reputable environment.  Narrators are 
essentially owners in the system, 
because everyone has an equal 
chance at prospering, based on the 
quality of their own actions in the 
network. 

The value of the Narrative Network is 
represented by the NRVE token, a 
cryptocurrency that is used to pay for 
items of value (channels, advertising, 
etc.) and reward the users who 
positively contribute to the network 
(content creation, commenting, votes, 
and more). 

Revenue sources for the Network will 
include: 

• Niche and Brand Channel 
Ownership Fees 

• Advertising 
• Issuance of NRVE Tokens 

� !5

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency


Revenue collected by the Network is 
held and disbursed in the following 
manner: 

• Content Creators: 60% 
• Narrative Organization: 15% 
• Niche Owners: 10% 
• Activity Rewards: 8% 
• Niche Moderators: 6% 
• Tribunal: 1% 

Let’s review the different types of 
users/areas in the system, so that it is 
easier to understand the payout 
structure above. 

Narrator 
Any registered user of the network. 
All users have their own (free) journal 
that they can post to anytime. 

Content Creator 
A Narrator who posts content on the 
network. 

The Narrative Organization 
The organization that manages the 
network software, infrastructure and 
marketing. 

Tribunal 
The Tribunal is like the “Supreme 
Court” of Narrative. Tribunal 
members are elected by the 
community, have steep qualification 

requirements, and serve time-limited 
terms.  The role of the Tribunal is to 
be the final arbiter of disputes, and 
the Tribunal has powers for taking 
action when necessary. 

Niche 
A Niche is a subject-oriented channel 
that any Narrator can post to.  Niches 
are created by Narrators, but each 
must be unique and must be 
approved by a vote of all Narrators 
who are “Rep Pos” (have a positive 
reputation).  Every authorized niche 
must have one owner and one or 
more moderators.  These owners and 
moderators earn Network Rewards, 
based on the overall popularity of 
each Niche. 

Brands 
Brands can set up Brand channels in 
Narrative, but Brand owners and 
moderators do not participate in 
Network Rewards. 

Activity Rewards 
Narrators earn activity points for 
various activities, including 
commenting, voting for nominated 
Niches, voting in Tribunal elections, 
up-voting/down-voting content, etc.  
Users who have earned activity points 
during a payout period are eligible for 
Activity Rewards. Note that users may 

� !6



receive negative activity points, as 
well, for behavior that is harmful to 
the network. 

Founders 
Any person that contributes 60 NEO 
or more in the Narrative Token Sale 
will be classified as a “Founder” when 
they register on the network using the 
same email account they used for the 
Token Sale.  Founders will receive the 
following special rewards: 

Niche Ownership Advantage: when 
we launch our early alpha, code-
named Chaucer, in March 2018, only 
Founders will be allowed to reserve/
purchase new niches for the first two 
weeks.  This gives them a huge 
competitive advantage in reserving 
the most popular subject areas. 

Activity Points Bonus: for each reward 
period, Founders will receive a 10% 
bonus for the number of Activity 
Points they accumulate. Thus, if the 
Founder generated 100 activity 
points, we would add 10 bonus points 
to his total. This will occur for the life 
of the Founder’s account. 

Exclusive Access: Founders will be 
granted exclusive access to the 
Narrative team via a dedicated Slack 
channel from the end of the Token 

Sale until the network is launched. 
This will give them more insight into 
the development progress before 
launch.

CENTRAL TENETS OF NARRATIVE 

AUTONOMY 
The community of users on the 
network create their own Niche 
channels, create the content, elect 
their own leaders and moderators, 
and even approve the ads that 
appear. The Narrative organization 
manages development of the  
software and pays for the 
infrastructure to keep things humming 
along, but has no involvement in 
managing the content posted to the 
network. 

TRANSPARENCY 
To have true autonomy, the entire 
system has to be as transparent as 
possible. With Narrative, every  
action taken by a moderator (or any 
user with any authority) is displayed 
for all to see. Every 
revenue-related transaction is 
cataloged in an immutable 
blockchain.  Anything of value or 
impact is visible for all to see. 

OWNERSHIP 
All users truly own their content and 
profile data in Narrative.  They can 
export their data anytime.  Ownership 
is also reflected in the role all users 
have in governing the network as a 
whole.  

ECONOMIC BENEFIT 
Users should be rewarded for 
behavior that benefits the network. 
Similarly, User Reputation should be 
an important factor in determining the  
impact of a user’s actions.  85% of all 
revenue generated by the network 
should be directed to its active users.   

NO CRYPTO BARRIERS 
Cryptocurrency is not highly adopted 
yet. Thus, the network cannot thrive 
and compete with other networks if it 
requires its users to use 
cryptocurrency.  Thus, advertisers will 
have the option to pay with fiat 
currency and network rewards can 
also be received in fiat currency 
(through a crypto/fiat conversion 
process). 

� !8



CONTENT IN NARRATIVE 

Narrative is designed to be the 
world’s journal- a place for individuals, 
groups, and businesses to tell their 
stories and post their thoughts.  A 
Narrative post might be a single 
photo, a collection of photos, text 
only, or a mixture of text and photos.  
The idea is that users can use their 
own Journals for personal 
perspectives, and/or use Niches to 
post about specific subjects.  Brand 
spaces give organizations a way to 
have more controlled areas where 
authorship is limited to authorized 
users only. 

Niches work similarly to tags during 
the content creation process. The 
author can associate his/her content 
with up to three niches.  Acceptance 
into a niche is subject to approval by 
niche moderators. The content 
creator may also suggest new niches, 

which would be subject to community 
approval. 

In general, we envision Narrative 
being a home for long-form content, 
but obviously Narrators will determine 
how to best utilize it.   

Narrators can follow Niches of 
interest, other Narrator’s Journals, and 
Brands. And they can view content via 
an aggregated stream of everything 
they follow or of course directly via 
the channel’s stream. 

The Reputation and Rating systems 
are used by Narrative to automatically 
bury low-rated content and feature 
highly rated content, though 
Narrators can customize their settings 
to disable or minimize these 
automations, if desired.   

� !9



PERSONAL JOURNALS 

Every registered member in Narrative has a Personal Journal.  This is their own 
personal Narrative, and the only content on a Personal Journal is the content by 
that journal owner. All journal content is always public and any registered 
member may comment. 

Personal Journals cannot have moderators. Personal Journals may be 
suspended by the Tribunal for any reason. (And note that users may report 
Personal Journal content to the Tribunal.)   

NICHES 

One of the three types of content 
channels, a Niche is a subject area 
into which any Narrator may publish 
content.  All Niches should be unique.  
You should not find one Niche called 
“New England Patriots” and another 
called “NE Patriots”.  The goal is to 
create unified content streams around 
singular subjects.  This helps create 
more focused content and allows 
Narrators to subscribe knowing that 
they are following all content on a 
given subject. 

That said, subjects may be quite 
broad or very narrow. For instance, an 
“NFL” niche is much broader than the 
“New England Patriots”, but they 
could coexist, since they are not 
identical. 

Each Niche that is created should 
have value.  And for that reason, the 
creation of new Niches goes through 
an approval process. 

1. A Narrator suggests/nominates a 
new Niche. 

2. Narrators vote during a 48-hour 
period.  The Reputation of each 
Narrator influences the impact of 
each vote. The higher the Rep, 
the more impactful the vote. 

3. Once the voting period is 
complete, if the Niche receives a 
vote score greater than 50% it 
becomes an authorized channel. 

� !10



Because Niches are essentially 
communal posting areas, it is critical 
that each one has an “owner” to act 
as the overall manager, as well as 
moderators for managing the content 
in the Niche.  Niche owners are 
responsible for nominating 
moderators in their channels, but Rep 
Pos Narrators actually elect each 
moderator that is nominated. 

There is only one owner per Niche. 
When a channel becomes authorized, 
it is then open for any Rep Pos 
Narrator to request to be the Niche 
owner.  Bids are accepted for a 48-
hour period for any new channel. 
Reputation will influence a user’s 
ability to bid and/or limit the number 
of bids the user may place for a niche. 
In addition, there will be a limit on the 
number of niches any one member 
may own. 

Both Owners and Moderators of a 
Niche are compensated for their 
efforts by participating in Network 
Rewards, based on the overall 
popularity of their channel, compared 
to others.  This incentivizes Owners to 
promote their channels and appoint 
excellent Moderators. In fact, Owners 

who do not have any Moderators for 
their Niches do not qualify for 
Network Rewards. 

It is important to avoid duplicate 
niches in Narrative. For that reason, 
any Narrator may report that a 
particular Niche is redundant.  Such 
reports will be reviewed by the 
Tribunal.  If more than 50% of Tribunal 
members agree that is redundant, it 
will be merged with the primary Niche 
and all content from the channel will 
be merged into the primary Niche. 
Refunds are not given to owners of 
redundant Niches.  The user who 
reports the redundant niche is 
awarded Activity Points, once it is 
determined to be redundant. 

Owners must pay an annual fee to 
purchase the Niche.  If they fail to 
renew the fee, the Niche is re-listed 
for a new Owner.  Annual fees are 
paid in NRVE tokens (though a fiat 
purchase option is available). 

Because some Niches may prove to 
be quite popular, we expect to see a 
land grab of Niche ownership. 
Maintaining ownership of Niches may  
prove quite profitable over time. 

� !11



BRANDS 

Narrative will support Brand channels.  
These are intended for organizations 
that wish to publish content on 
Narrative but need to control who can 
post the content on its channel.  They 
are also ideal for publishers.  Brand 
Owners appoint their own 
Moderators, but, unlike Niches, their 
Moderator choices do not have to be 
approved by the vote of the 
community. Brand channels also have 
the option to exclude network ads (for 
a fee). 

Brands pay a premium ownership fee 
for the special privileges they receive. 
In addition, Brand Owners and 
Moderators do not participate in 
Network Rewards.   

As with Niches, each new Brand 
channel must be approved by the 
community via a vote available for any 
Rep Pos Narrator.  This allows the 
community to ensure that each 
channel on the site reflects their 
overall values.  In addition, a Brand 
can lose its rights to function by 
Narrator petition to the Tribunal. 
Brands have some other unique 
qualities: 

1. Moderator Payments 

Unlike with Niches, Brand Moderators 
do not qualify for Network Rewards. 
The reason they do not is because the 
brand has tighter control over the 
selection of Moderators (there is no 
community vote). Many brands will 
want strict control over the 
moderators they employ, so this 
makes sense. 
 
However, Narrative still provides a 
mechanism for Brands to optionally 
pay their Moderators.  With the 
Moderator Compensation feature, a 
Brand can set a specific recurring 
payment rate per moderator.  These 
payments can be in NRVE tokens, or 
can be a fixed dollar amount that is 
auto-converted to NRVE by the 
system at the time of payment.   

When enabled, the Brand will be able 
to deposit fiat currency or NRVE 
tokens that the system will draw upon 
to auto- pay each moderator every 
pay period. If depositing in fiat 
currency, a 15% conversion fee is 
applied, in order to encourage the 

� !12



Brand to deposit NRVE tokens 
directly instead (as well as to account 
for the exchange rate risk and 
processing costs).  

On pay day, if the Brand has 
insufficient funds to cover the 
moderator payments, the Brand will 
be given 24 hours to deposit a 
sufficient amount. After 24 hours, if 
still short on funds, the Brand site will 
be suspended (and will not be 
reinstated until the balance is paid in 
full). 

2. Content Creator Reward 
Overrides 

Some Brands may wish to require that 
the Brand Owner share in the Content 
Reward for all content published in 
the site. 

For instance, imagine a use case 
where a publication wishes to use 
Narrative as a platform.  The 
publication Owner could require that 
all of its published content is split 
50/50 with the authors.   

Another example: a company that is 
already paying the salary for its 
content authors may wish to have all 
Content Creator revenue flow directly 
to the Brand Owner. 

With the optional Content Creator 
Reward Override, the Brand Owner 
can designate exactly how content 
created in the Brand Site is credited in 
terms of Content Creator rewards, by 
setting a percentage allocation for the 
Owner and a percentage for the 
Creator. 

3. Editors 

Brands offer a unique role- Editors.  
Editors are similar to moderators, but 
their role is to serve as reviewers of 
new content.  The use of Editors is 
optional; when enabled, the site can 
set rules about how editors interact 
with new content. For instance, a rule 
could be set to force all content to be 
reviewed by an Editor prior to 
publication, or even to have two 
different editors review content 
before publication.  Editors also may 
edit the author’s content, as well as 
set Child Rating, and set publication 
date/time. 

Brand Owners do not receive any 
Network Rewards for their role; 
however, just as with Moderator 
Payments described above, Brand 
Owners may designate specific 
payments to Editors, as well, if 
desired, on a recurring basis.   

� !13



TRANSPARENCY  
One of the hallmarks of Narrative is 
transparency.  Because it is an 
autonomous, user-run community, it is 
important that as much information as 
possible is available to all users, 
including: 

• Actions Performed by 
Moderators: users must be able to 
see every action a moderator takes 
so that performance can be 
monitored and moderators are 
accountable for their actions. 
Narrators can evict problematic 
Moderators by popular vote. 

• Approval of New Niches: new 
channels should not be added 
without the community of users 
reviewing them first. This ensures 
that new “subjects” are not 
introduced without general consent. 

• Approval of Ads: Advertisements 
must also be reviewed in advance to 
ensure that they meet the standards 
the community of users adheres to. 

• Child Protection: content creators 
can indicate whether the content 
they posted is kid-friendly or not. 
Content not rated kid-friendly is 

automatically hidden from users 
under age 18 (and for users not 
signed in). Moderators can modify 
the status anytime, as well. Note 
that there is an overall age limit of 
13 for registering on Narrative. 

• Revenue: on every user profile, 
Narrative will display the revenue 
earned by that user currently and all 
time (with graphs).  In addition, each 
content item will display how much 
it has earned the creator.  Network 
rewards each month will also be 
summarized (revenue per source 
and how distributed).  The platform 
will also display how much 
advertisers pay for each ad 
(historical log).  Fiat conversation 
fees collected by the Organization 
will also be made available for 
anyone to see. 

• Niche and Brand VIPs: every Niche 
and Brand will display its current 
owner and all moderators and users 
will be able to contact them via 
private message. Private messages 
will only be supported between 
users and owners/moderators, 
however. No user-to-user direct 
messages will be supported initially. 

� !14



• Organization Financials: the 
audited financials for the 
organization will be reported online 
every year. 

• Tribunal Elections: all Tribunal 
elections will be held online and a 
list of all current Tribunal members 
will also be posted.  

� !15



GOVERNANCE 

While the Organization is responsible for all product development, marketing, 
and infrastructure management for the network, it has no role in terms of 
content policies or management, user management, or overall governance of 
the day-to-day activities inside the network.  The Terms of Service will clearly 
stipulate this, as well as assert the Network Reward payouts. 

Activity within the network is to be governed by the network users themselves.  
In fact, the network users can also alter the network payout structure and the 
activity point system. In order to ensure the continued operation of the 
organization as the provider of the infrastructure.  However, the Organization is 
guaranteed to always receive at least 15% of all network revenue.  The 
Organization also controls the fee to charge for fiat conversion, as well as all 
channel ownership fee rates.   

A community-elected Tribunal is the governing body of the network, and it has 
final say on issues within the community.  Major policy changes must be 
approved by the Tribunal, as well, and are also subject to approval by the 
community at large. The Tribunal is compensated via Network Rewards. 

The Narrative Committee serves as a bridge between the Organization and the 
Network.  Representatives from the Organization and the Network will serve on 
the committee, which shall meet quarterly to review issues, plan for changes, 
and consider amendments to operations.  This Committee also has oversight of 
Content Taxonomy for the Network. While the Network has no authority over 
issues involving software, infrastructure, or marketing, it will have a voice.  
Similarly, the Organization has no authority in terms of content or user 
management on the Network, but it will have a seat at the table to understand 
issues that may require software or infrastructure improvements.  This will be a 
small group, comprised of at least 4 but no more than 12 people (split evenly 
between Network and Organization).  The Network will elect its representatives 
once per year, but only Tribunal members will qualify.  The Committee will be 
formed one year after the network officially launches. Until that time, the 
Organization will oversee Content Taxonomy management. 

� !16



NETWORK REWARDS 

The lifeblood of the network is the Network Rewards fund. All revenue 
generated by the network, including new token generation (after the genesis 
token generation event), advertising sales, and channel ownership fees, is always 
included in the Network Rewards fund and the fund is distributed on a recurring 
basis in the following manner: 

� !17



The only revenue not included in Network Rewards is Fiat Conversion Fees, 
which are always paid 100% to the Organization, which processes all such 
transactions.  Note that payouts do not include gas fees (fees required to 
process each transaction on the blockchain), which may reduce some payouts.  
Reward recipients do not have to own any NRVE tokens to qualify for rewards. 

Until advertising becomes a vital part of the system, the revenue generated from 
minting of new tokens (retained by the network) will be a significant source of 
revenue for the network, with the value predicated on the market value of the 
tokens.  

To better explain how the network will sustain itself via the proposed business 
model, the following table provides an example (though none of the specific 
dollar amounts should be construed as projections). 

� !18



Network Reward distributions are made each month (though a more frequent 
distribution may be used), based on activity in the previous month.  Let’s break 
down how things are divvied up: 

A. Content Creators 
Narrative calculates all content that had activity in the month, with activity being 
defined as comments and up or down votes.  User reputation impacts each 
assessed activity. Each content item is given a score for the month based on the 
activity in that month (this is independent of its overall score, which reflects all-
time activity). 

Once all eligible content has been scored for the month, the content is ranked.  
Only the top 90% of all content is eligible for Content Creator rewards. In 
addition, content by users with very low Reputation Scores is not eligible.  This is 
done to prevent users from trying to game the system for recurring payments.  
Each content item’s share of the Content Creators rewards is based on this 
formula: 

( Content Item Score / Aggregated Content Score For Eligible Content ) *  Content 
Creator Rewards Value 

B. Narrative Organization 
The organization receives 15% of the Network Rewards Fund value. 

C. Niche Owners 
The share paid to each Niche owner is based on the Content Rankings for the 
previous month described above for the Content Creators reward.  Once the 
Content Creators rankings are completed, those content items posted in Niches 
are correlated to each Niche.   Each Niche is then given an aggregated score 
based on the total Content Scores for all associated content items.  Each Niche 
then receives a pro rata share of the Niche Owners reward, based on this 
formula: 

( Niche Content Score / Content Score For All Niches ) *  Niche Owner Rewards Value 

� !19



D. Niche Moderators 
Payouts to Niche Moderators directly correlate to the payouts to Niche Owners. 
Thus, the Niche Content Scores calculated in C above are used to calculate the 
Niche Moderator payouts. Thus, this formula is used to calculate the payout for 
each Niche Moderator: 

( ( Niche Content Score / Content Score For All Niches ) *  Niche Moderators Rewards 
Value) / Number of Moderators In Niche 

E. Activity Rewards Recipients 
Anyone who received activity points in the previous month qualifies for Activity 
rewards. There are number ways to earn activity points (including comments, up/
down voting, etc.), and each qualifying event has its own point formula.   

Note that a bonus is applied to Activity Point totals for the period based on 
each user’s month-end Reputation Rank, like so: 

For Founders, the Reputation Rank bonus is applied after the Founder bonus 
(10%) is applied. 

The formula for calculating payout per Activity Points holder is: 

(User Activity Point Total For Month  / Total Activity Points Issued In Month) * Activity 
Rewards Value 

G. Tribunal 
Tribunals split the Tribunal rewards equally, based on the number of Tribunal 
members at the end of the previous month.

REVENUE FLOWS AND THE FIAT 
CONVERSION OPTION 

Though Narrative uses a cryptocurrency to process all transactions, it is 
important that the system is designed so that users do not have to have any 
understanding of cryptocurrency, nor require that they set up cryptocurrency 
wallets.  After all, the process of establishing and maintaining crypto wallets is 
fairly complicated currently. 

To accomplish this, many payment and payout mechanisms in the system will 
support fiat conversion into US Dollars.  Note that Niche channel ownership fees 
will not have a Fiat Conversion option, however.  The Organization will manage 
and process all such conversation between the NRVE tokens and fiat currency.  
Any time a user pays or withdraws in fiat currency, however, a 15% fiat 
conversion fee will be applied.  The fiat conversion fees will be retained by the 
Organization and are not included in Network Rewards. 

To be clear, in all cases, NRVE tokens will be applied.  With the fiat option, 
entities and users have the option to pay or receive in fiat, but the underlying 
transactions are all conducted using NRVE tokens. 

For example: 

1. Advertisers will be quoted in NRVE, but may alternatively pay in fiat.   
2. Narrators who have earned NRVE tokens via Network Rewards may opt for 

cashing out in fiat instead. 

For revenue paid in fiat, the Organization will purchase NRVE tokens on the 
open market using the fiat funds and then place the purchased tokens in the 
Network Rewards fund.  Similarly, for payouts to Narrators for Network Rewards 
balances, the Organization will sell NRVE tokens on the open market and use 
the proceeds to pay the Narrators in fiat.  Because this process may be time-
consuming, Network Rewards payouts made in fiat also may take up to 15 days 
to process. 

� !21



It’s possible that efficiencies may be developed, as well, for example, to 
automatically swap tokens required for an advertisement purchase with tokens 
sold for reward payouts, reducing the net market order transactions.  

Let’s take a closer look at how revenue flows into and out of the network.  In all 
cases, tokens are the currency that powers all transactions.   

Below, you will find a diagram that details the inflow of revenue.  Fiat payments 
are always converted to tokens for inclusion in the Reward Fund, which is 
comprised only of tokens. 

And here is a look at revenue outflows- payments to members who earn 
rewards.

STAKING VALUE IN THE NETWORK 

Niches and Brands are purchased by an “owner”.  Each owner pays an annual 
fee (in NRVE tokens) to maintain the Niche or Brand.  For Niches, the annual fee 
for new Niches will be set at the start of each month based on the following 
formula (20% of average ownership payout per niche): 

( ( (Previous Month Network Rewards Fund Value * 0.10) / Total Niches) * 12 ) * 0.20 

The annual renewal fee for a specific Niche will be calculated using this formula 
(20% of previous year’s revenue for channel): 

Previous Year Total Ownership Payout In Tokens For That Niche  * 0.2  

For Niches, initial and renewal fees are subject to a minimum of US$75/year, 
however. For Brands, the annual fees will be fixed (price TBD). 

Niche ownership fees must be paid using NRVE tokens. 

Note that when the network initially supports niches, Founders will be given at 
least two-week head start in reserving/purchasing the first set of niches.  During 
this phase, only Founders will be able to reserve new niches.

USER REPUTATION AND CONTENT 
RATINGS 

A critical component of a completely 
community-run system is User 
Reputation and Content Ratings.  
Every Narrator has a Reputation Score 
and Rank that is based on all of the 
actions taken by the user.  All content 
is rated based on Narrator opinions.  
Importantly, Narrator Reputation 
always influences Content Ratings.  
And how a Narrator’s content is rated 
impacts his/her Reputation. 

In this manner, Reputation reflects the 
actions of a user, as well as how 
others perceive the user.  Reputation 
is also tracked over time, so a 
Narrator’s Reputation is graphed and 
is easily followed by any user in the 
system.  An improving Reputation 
over time can be rewarded 
systematically via Activity Points, for 
instance, providing economic 
incentives to users who improve their 
stand in the overall community. 

Importantly Reputation and Content 
Ratings also impact Network Rewards.  
For instance, every Content Creator is 
eligible to receive Network Rewards, 
but the user’s Reputation and the 
Content Ratings for the content 

posted impact the reward payout 
(and, in some cases, low ranking/
ratings may preclude the Narrator 
from receiving rewards). 

Reputation 

The Reputation Score is based on a 
formula that considers the following 
factors, among others: 

• Age of Account (how long since 
registered) 

• Average Content Rating (based on 
posts and comments made by 
user) 

• Correlation between a user’s votes 
and overall content scores (as well 
as user’s votes and other 
outcomes). In other words, do the 
user’s votes correlate to general 
community voting results. 

• Activity Points received in the past 
month (and recent months) (more 
is better) 

Reputation Scores and Rankings are 
updated once per day. Rankings are 
based on how the user’s score ranks 
compared to all other scores, using 
the standard competition ranking 

� !25



method.  These rankings are 
important in that they are the 
multipliers used for most voting 
mechanisms in the system. 

Content Ratings 

Every piece of content has a rating/
score based on the up and down 
votes by the audience.  Each vote is 
weighted based on the Reputation 
Score of the voter, as well. Thus, a 
user with a higher Reputation Rank 
will have more impact on the content 
rating than a user with a lower 
Reputation Rank. 

Note that a “kid-friendly” flag is 
available for each piece of content 
and comment.  If unchecked, the 
content/comment will not be 
displayed for users under the age of 
18.   When a user creates content or 
comments, he can determine whether 
this is checked or not. Moderators can 
also change this setting.  (Note the 
network will require all users be 13 or 
older.) 

Content flagged as “not kid-friendly” 
will never be displayed to users under 
18 years old. 

While the formulas used to assess 
Reputation and Content Ratings may 
change over time, the Reputation and 

Ratings system is a primary 
component for ensuring community 
harmony and rewarding the Narrators 
who are the most positive influence.  
Machine learning may aid with 
assessments over time, but will never 
replace ongoing assessments by 
Narrators. 

� !26



CONTENT MODERATION 

Without oversight, an ecosystem of 
content created by a large number of 
users may degrade, overrun by 
spammers and other ne’er-do-wells.   

Narrative supports moderation in two 
ways: 

1. Automated Rules and Machine 
Learning 

Numerous automated rules are in 
place to reduce the effort required by 
the human moderators. Examples: 

Niches 

a. New content and comments 
posted by users who have 
registered within the past week is 
always moderated (not published 
until approved by an elected 
moderator), except within the first 
month of a niche start date. 

b. Content or comments posted by 
users with negative Reputation 
Scores are always moderated. 

c. Content or comments by users 
with low Reputation Ranks are 
buried.  

d. Content or comments posted by 
users with extremely low 

Reputation Ranks are not 
permitted. 

Personal Journals 

a. Users with low Reputation Scores 
are prevented from posting to 
their own personal journals.  
When scores move above the 
minimum threshold, though, 
permission is granted. 

b. Comments on Personal Journals 
are not permitted by users with 
negative Reputation Scores. 

c. Personal Journals with content 
with an average rating that is very 
low may have its content buried 
and may be subject to review by 
The Tribunal (and may receive a 
temporary/permanent ban). 

Brands 

a. Comments on Brand channels are 
not permitted by users with 
negative Reputation Scores. 

b. Brands that consistently post 
content by users with low 
Reputation Ranks or with Content 
Ratings that are low are subject to 
review by The Tribunal and may 
have their brand channels 
revoked. 

� !27



2. Human Moderation 

All Niche and Brand channels have 
their own moderators, responsible for 
policing and curating the content 
within their channels.  Each Narrator 
also acts as personal moderator for 
their own Journal, allowing them to 
remove or disable comments. 

For Niches, moderators are 
nominated by their Owners, but must 
be elected by a vote of all followers of 
the Niche.  The influence of each vote 
depends on the Reputation Rank of 
the voter.  All actions performed by 
Moderators are logged and viewable 
by all users.  If the Niche users are 
unhappy with a particular moderator, 
they can petition the Owner to 
remove the Moderator.  (Note: 
Owners can also be removed by 
petition to The Tribunal.) 

For Brands, moderators are selected 
by the Owner.  There is no community 
vote.  However, all moderator actions 
are also logged and viewable by all 
users.  Users may petition The 
Tribunal to request removal of a Brand 
channel. 

The Tribunal serve as the top-level 
decision-makers to make final 

decisions concerning content and 
users. 

The Moderator Pool 

Because moderators are so vital to 
the success of the community, 
Narrative will also support a 
Moderator Pool, where channels can 
advertise openings and moderators 
can list their availability.  

Niche Owners will not qualify for 
Network Rewards unless they have 
moderators in place, so this area may 
be crucial to help channels recruit and 
place moderators.   

Owners will be able to see the 
Reputation Score/Rank for each 
potential moderator, as well as any 
channels the moderator is or has 
moderated.  Moderators soliciting for 
jobs can indicate whether they prefer 
Niche and/or Brand gigs, as well as 
subjects of interest. 

There is no limit to the number of 
channels a user can moderate.  We 
see the moderation role being a vital 
part of the system’s health, and 
envision talented, dedicated 
moderators taking on multiple 
moderator gigs in the content 
economy, generating significant 
revenue for themselves in the process. 

� !28



USER MODERATION 

The Tribunal will be granted authority to ban/remove any registered member of 
the network.  Tribunal members will have access to reports that identify 
potentially problematic users and may take proactive measures.  

A member may be banned from specific channels. For Personal Journals, the 
journal owner may ban any other user from participating on his/her site.  For 
Niches and Brands, moderators may ban users.  For Personal Journals, the 
ability to ban only conveys if the banner is Reputation Positive.  All ban actions 
will appear in the Channel Logs (for all channel types), just like any other 
moderator actions. 

Channel bans may be temporary or permanent.  All channel-specific banning will 
be listed on the person’s profile (transparent for everyone) and will impact the 
user’s reputation score.   

If a member feels he has been improperly banned, he may appeal to the banner 
and, if not resolved, may appeal to the Tribunal, which has final authority.   

If a member is found to be improperly banning people (for instance to harm 
their reputation), the Tribunal may take punitive action against the banner. 

� !29



DECENTRALIZATION 

The goal of the project is to be as 
decentralized as possible, while still 
offering blazingly fast performance, 
powerful search capabilities, and 
support for user control over content 
(including the ability to edit and 
delete your own content anytime).  

Thus, due to current limitations with 
blockchain technology, the initial 
implementation will likely begin as a 
hybrid application that combines a 
centralized content management 
system with decentralized blockchain 
systems.  Over time, though, the goal 
is to be as decentralized as possible, 
while still offering outstanding 
performance.   

The system will likely use 
decentralized identity management 
services for users, as well. 

Storing the content in a decentralized 
manner is an important goal, even if it 

is not achieved initially.  It is equally 
important, however, that users be 
able to edit and delete their content.  
Privacy regulations like the GDPR 
must be adhered to; members of the 
system must have control over their 
data.  Such regulations in many ways 
fly in the face of an immutable ledger, 
and must be considered when 
considering which elements are 
stored in a blockchain. 

While NEO will be utilized for the 
NRVE  cryptocurrency, the system will 
likely utilize another blockchain/
distributed ledger system to manage 
a broader scope of transactions 
(including the recording of fiat 
payments). Various systems will be 
considered for that, including IOTA, 
Hyperledger, and others.

TOKEN SALE 

The NRVE token will be the utility currency for the network and the genesis 
block of those tokens for the system will be created at the conclusion of a Token 
Sale. This will set the initial value of the network and provide the resources to 
launch the Organization. 

100 million NRVE coins will be minted during the Token Sale and distributed in 
the following manner: 

� !31

https://tokensale.narrative.network
https://tokensale.narrative.network
https://tokensale.narrative.network


Tokens reserved for the Company Reserves will be used for content creator 
enticements, marketing, corporate operations, other incentives designed to 
increase the branding and influence of the network, and other purposes 
required by the Organization. 

The Token Sale schedule will be listed on our Token Sale site at http://
tokensale.narrative.network.  Up to 50 million tokens will be sold in the 
crowdsale. 

Whitelist 
Users will be required to register to participate in the Token Sale (at any stage). 
The registration process will include collection of KYC information, as well as 
AML checks to ensure that funds from illegal sources are not used.  The 
registrants will supply the NEO account to be used for contributions. Those 
authorized accounts will serve as a whitelist for the Token Sale.  The only 
accepted form of payment will be NEO. 

New registrations may be capped at times, or permanently, depending on 
overall demand.  Users from certain countries may also be prevented from 
participating; currently, only citizens of China are prohibited, but this list of 
countries may change at any time.  

Caps and Unsold Tokens 
If the Token Sale fails to sell more than 30,000 NEO, the Organization will cancel 
the Token Sale and refund all proceeds to users. The hard cap is approximately 
166,667 NEO.   Unsold tokens will be burned.  

Vesting 
Tokens granted to the Team will be subject to a 3-year vesting period that 
begins only when the network actually launches.  Tokens granted to the 
Company Reserves will be vested over a 2-year period.

USE OF FUNDS 

An early alpha of the platform focusing on niches will be available on the last 
day of the Token Sale (March 22, 2018).  The money raised from the sale of 
tokens will be used to help fund operations of the Organization for the first 3 - 5 
years, or until the revenue from the network is able to fully fund operations.  As 
such, it will be used for human resources, infrastructure costs (legal, licensing, 
contractors, office space, data centers, etc.), and marketing. 
 

� !33



TOKEN SUPPLY 

100 million tokens will be issued as part of the Token Sale, with a maximum of 
197.5 million tokens issued lifetime.  Once Narrative is released as a service, 
new NRVE tokens will be minted (and released directly into the Network 
Rewards fund) over a period of 30 years, with a maximum of 5 million issued in 
each of the first 10 years and then a decreasing amount for the remainder until 
the 197.5 million maximum limit is reached. 

� !34



LANGUAGE 

Narrative will focus on the English language only, initially. However, the plan is to 
support unique communities per language. Thus, we anticipate launching 
Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese, Italian, and other languages on the 
platform.  Each language will be a separate Narrative site that does not share 
members or content with other Narrative sites, but that still use the same NRVE 
token system. 

In some cases, however, if a language primarily serves one market  (like China 
and India), we will roll out customized versions of the platform that use their own 
cryptographic token.  These specialized networks may also utilize a different 
network name.   Note that some countries, like China, have their own laws 
regarding blockchain technology, so taking this approach will allow us to serve 
markets that may have unique requirements.   

Each language will have its own unique set of channels (niches, brands, etc.), 
significantly increasing the overall value of the network through additional 
channel ownership fees and advertising. 

The relative market sized by country is listed below.

selected-countries/ 

� !36



THE TRIBUNAL 

The Tribunal is the ultimate governing authority of the network.  This elected 
group of people can make final decisions regarding content and users.  One of 
the primary day-to-day tasks of the Tribunal is oversight of the taxonomy of the 
network.  The Tribunal has final say over whether a particular niche is unique, for 
example, and reviews/manages community input about niche appropriateness 
and content in general. 

The Organization decides the maximum number of Tribunal members, and that 
number will scale as the size of the network increases over time.   

If less than three Tribunal elected members are active, the Organization will 
appoint temporary Tribunal members (from amongst the Narrative community) 
until such time as at least three community-elected Tribunal members are in 
place. 

To become a Tribunal member, a network user can apply for an open position 
(via the Tribunal Openings page), but the user must meet the following 
requirement at time of election: 

• Have a Reputation Rank Greater Than 75% 

The term of a Tribunal member is one year. After one year, the position goes up 
for re-election. The Tribunal member is free to apply again, but has no 
advantage compared to any other qualified users. A Tribunal Member may not 
serve more than 10 terms. 

� !37



THE ORGANIZATION 

The Organization manages the 
software development, infrastructure, 
and marketing for the platform.  All 
infrastructure costs are borne by the 
Organization. 

The Organization has no authority to 
manage content or users on the 
network.  Its overall goals for the 
network however, are: 

1. Provide a frictionless system for 
rewarding the contributors to the 
network. 

2. Provide automated tools to ease 
the moderation burden for 
moderators. 

3. Allow users to manage their 
profile and delete their accounts 
and content any time. 

4. Protect all users’ privacy. Users 
must consent to allowing any 
profile information from being 
shared with any third parties, 
including advertisers (and be 
rewarded if they do). 

5. Provide outstanding software that 
works well on all devices. 

6. Strive for as much decentralization 
as possible, while still providing an 
outstanding experience. 

All costs in operating the system will 
be borne by the Organization, so that 
usage is always free for users. Users 
should only ever pay “gas” fees (for 
blockchain transactions) when they 
buy or sell NRVE tokens (perform a 
financial transaction). 

The Organization will only be 
retaining 15% of network revenue*, 
but by operating as a lean 
organization we are confident the 
model will succeed.  In addition, 
revenue for the Organization will be 
substantially supplemented in the 
early years by the revenue from the 
Token Sale. 

* Note that fiat conversion fees will also be 
received by the Organization. 

� !38



ADVERTISING 
An advertising system will be added 
to Narrative, to be completed within 6 
months of the beta launch of the 
platform.  This system will be an 
important cornerstone of the network.  
Importantly, advertisers will never 
have access to any personally 
identifiable information for network 
users (unless specifically authorized by 
each user) and no data about users 
will ever be sold by Narrative.   

Advertisers will bid on ad space for 
specific niches/keywords/
demographics.  Auctions will be 
automated and based on specific 
time periods (one week or one 
month).   

Ads based on demographics (user 
location, age, gender) will only be 
targeted at users that have authorized 
sharing their demographic info to 
advertisers.  Such users will also be 
compensated by receiving Activity 
Points for each month that they 
authorize targeted demographic-
based ads. 

Here’s how the advertising bidding 
process will work: 

1. Advertiser chooses one or more 
channels/tags/demos to advertise 
to.  Ads are sold in units of time 
(one week, for example, not pay 
per click or pay per view).  The ad 
can be targeted for a time period 
in the future, as well. Advertiser 
posts ad content when bidding.  
Dynamic pricing will be used to 
set proper price points per ad, 
based on historical traffic data. 

2. When Advertiser submits new ad, 
he pays associated fee, but ad is 
still subject to approval by the 
community at large (over a 48-
hour period).  This ensures that 
ads meet the community’s 
standards.  Users who vote on ads 
are rewarded with Activity Points.  

3. If ad is not approved in public 
vote, the advertising fee paid is 
refunded to advertiser. If ad is 
approved, it is scheduled for 
display on schedule supplied by 
advertiser.   

4.  Brands have option to disable ads   
 (for additional fee). 

� !39



100% of all advertising revenue will be contributed to the Network Rewards 
fund.  Advertisers can pay with NRVE tokens or with US Dollars, though a Fiat 
Conversion Fee of 15% is added, if paying with fiat currency.   

HOW USERS COLLECT NETWORK 
REWARDS 

Each payout period, Narrative 
distributes the payouts for the 
Network Rewards and updates each 
user’s profile with the amounts to be 
credited based on the prior period’s 
activity. Users may collect multiple 
rewards (based on being Content 
Creator, Niche Moderator, Activity 
Points, etc.). 

Narrators will see the current credit 
(as well as total credit available, if 
previous credits were not claimed).  
The credits must be formally claimed 
by the user via their control panel.  
The credits will be shown as both 
NRVE tokens and US Dollar 
equivalent (based on exchange rate at 
that time).  If the user prefers fiat 
payment (US Dollars), payment is 
made via a third party (such as PayPal) 
and there is a Fiat Conversion Fee.  
The Fiat Conversion Option also 

requires up to 15 days to process.  
There is no handling fee if receiving 
NRVE tokens instead and, in that 
scenario, the payout is instant via a 
standard NEO transaction. The user 
simply provides his/her wallet address 
and the tokens are transferred to 
them.  The user can also store wallet 
addresses (or PayPal addresses) on 
their profile for easy transfer in the 
future (and once set up, the user can 
have auto-claiming turned on). 

Importantly, if user has not claimed 
any rewards in over one year, all 
tokens will be reclaimed by the 
system in this manner:  100% returned 
to the Network Rewards fund for 
redistribution.  Users have no 
recourse once tokens are reclaimed; 
rewards will not be reissued.   
Reminders will be sent to users two 
weeks before tokens expire. 

� !40



TIPS 

While the Network Rewards are the primary economic engine of Narrative, the 
system also allows users to send each other “tips” using their existing token 
balances, for any reason.   Common use cases would be to send a tip to a 
Content Creator who created great content, or perhaps an Owner tipping a 
Moderator for handling a difficult situation.   

Basically, any Narrative member can tip any other member, using any portion of 
their personal Narrative balance, including balances that they have not yet 
claimed.  There is no limit to the amount that can be tipped, other than the 
available balance on the tipper’s account, but all tips are non refundable.  

When received, tips are added to a member’s overall token balance and thus are 
eligible for conversion to fiat, as well, if desired. 

The tips mechanism may be extended in the future for supporting things like 
crowdfunding to encourage someone to create content on a certain subject.   

TIMELINE 

An early alpha of the platform focused solely on niches, will be available in 
March 2018, with the complete network scheduled to launch (as beta) in Q4 
2018.  We have set the following timeline for the first two years: 

� !41

https://blog.narrative.network/announcing-chaucer-1e47311d93fc


 

MARKET SIZE 

The market size for social media is obviously already proven and massive.  Per 
Statista, the number of people using social media in 2017 is 2.46 billion and that 
number is projected to reach 3.02 billion by 2021. 

Per Statista, Social media marketing spending is expected to reach nearly $17.5 
billion by 2019. 

� !42



However, we view Narrative as much more than a social media disruptor.  We 
see it disrupting the publishing industry, especially traditional magazine and 
newspaper models, because content creators will have less reliance on 
publishers, who reap most of the profits from the content they create.  In the 
Narrative ecosystem, writers, photographers, and other creatives can publish 
their work directly and reap significant rewards without a middleman.   

� !43



LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The goal of Narrative is to give users 
control over their content by not 
allowing anyone (not even 
moderators) to edit their content in 
any way and by allowing users to 
remove their content from the 
network at any time.  That last point 
will be an important consideration 
when designing the platform, 
because a traditional feature of 
decentralized applications that use 
blockchain is that the content is 
immutable (cannot be deleted). Thus, 
the platform will need to ensure that 
user control (including editing/
deleting) is supported, regardless of 
the technology put in place. 

Another consideration, especially 
since the system is being managed by 
the network users, is how to deal with 
things like copyright infringement, 
illegal activities, and government 
take-down notices. 

If and when the content is 
decentralized, the location of the 
content becomes ambiguous.  
Furthermore, the Organization will 
have no authority over the 

management or the content, but it 
will have to comply with legal 
government take-down notices. 

The overall goal of the platform is to 
allow the community to determine 
what content is appropriate and 
displayed through the Reputation and 
Content Rating system, as well as via 
the Moderators and the elected 
Tribunal.  But Narrative needs to limit 
the legal exposure that those 
individuals have, since they are simply 
making best efforts to take actions 
that reflect the desires of the 
community at large. 

To what extent can a community of 
users, spanning many cultures and 
governments, impose its own 
publication guidelines (decide what 
stays and what goes) without being 
superseded by any one government’s 
edicts, especially if the content itself is 
only controlled by the user that 
created it?   
 

� !44



These are fairly profound questions that must be accounted for in the Terms of 
Service. The Organization will seek to protect the rights of the network users, 
but acknowledges that compliance with government directives will be necessary.  

MARKET COMPARISON 
There is strong evidence that the 
model proposed by Narrative will 
thrive.   

Steemit is a blockchain-powered 
social network modeled after Reddit. 
It uses complicated cryptocurrency 
models (multiple crypto token types) 
to reward content creators based on 
the number of up-votes received.  It 
currently has a market valuation of 
over $1.4 billion million (as of Jan 26, 
2018, per CoinMarketCap.com) and 
has seen steady adoption over time, 
albeit mainly by users who are familiar 
with the cryptocurrency space, due to 
its overall design.  

Authors on the Steemit network have 
realized significant income by posting 
quality content. 

Narrative significantly enhances upon 
the nascent model developed by 
Steemit by incorporating reputation, 

moderation, governance, and 
transparency; by providing a more 
flexible and deeper rewards system; 
by supporting powerful search 
features; and by developing a more 
complete, structured content system.   

In addition, Narrative has tangible 
revenue sources (advertising, channel 
ownership fees, etc.) in its economic 
model and does not require crypto in 
order to use/benefit from the 
network. 

It’s also being developed by a team 
with over 20 years’ experience 
building online community platforms. 
In fact, the development of the 
Narrative platform will be jumpstarted 
by licensing core technology from 
Social Strata.  

Here is a comparison of Narrative with 
Steem, as well as some major social 
media networks:

TEAM 

Narrative was founded by Ted O’Neill, who is also founder and CEO of Social 
Strata, Inc.  Social Strata’s flagship product is Hoop.la, a SaaS online community 
platform, with customers that include Pepsi, Bose, Dun & Bradstreet and 
Monster.  Hoop.la is a highly scalable platform for user generated content and 
much of the technology developed for that platform will be licensed by 
Narrative in order to jumpstart development.   

A few of the executives from Social Strata will be joining Ted on the Narrative 
team, including Brian Lenz, CTO, and Rosemary O’Neill, the marketing officer 
for the company.  Dr. Michael Farris, will also join the management team. 
Michael has extensive technology experience, much of it focusing on community 
development and management. 

With nearly twenty years of experience developing enterprise-class applications, 
all focused on user-generated content management, the Narrative team is 
uniquely qualified to deliver on its promises.   

Advisors for the project include: 

Christopher S. Penn: Vice President of Marketing at SHIFT Communications, 
best-selling author, and noted keynote speaker. 

Michael B. Moore: former Coca Cola brand manager and current CEO of the 
International African American Museum. 

Chris Pirilllo: noted content creator (the Locker Gnome) and influencer.  

Paul B. Allen: founder of Ancestry.com, keynote speaker, tech entrepreneur. 

Sergey Vasin: COO, BlackmoonCrypto.

THE FUTURE 

While the initial focus is on blog content, Narrative’s ultimate goal is to be the 
Amazon of content, eventually offering support for podcasts, video, and 
potentially even original programming/films.  The content economy created and 
maintained by Narrative can be extended to support brand-controlled 
advertising (for organizations with large audiences of their own) and premium 
memberships. 

The goal is to be the home for content of all types, whether created by 
“amateurs” or professionals.  The ratings and reputation systems baked into 
Narrative only enhance the content marketplace as it extends.  The transparency 
of the system ensures fairness for all participants. 

By focusing on the economic benefit for participants in the network, Narrative is 
uniquely positioned to create a true land of opportunity for creators and a fertile 
ground of discovery for consumers of content of all types.

SUMMARY 

It’s time to disrupt the business models for social media networks and traditional 
publishing.  Narrative’s content economy will revolutionize social media 
networks and content publications.  Its mandate is to put users first and to 
provide an economic motive for success by compensating members based on 
the quality and popularity of their content, and any positive contributions to the 
network’s ecosystem as a whole. 

With a completely user-run governance system and a transparent approach to 
data, Narrative truly gives the power to the people and completely cuts out the 
middleman.   

Content will live or die based on its popularity and the morals and opinions of 
the community at large.  There will be no censorship by a monolithic 
organization, and the moderation that does occur will be enacted by users 
elected by the people. 

While Narrative utilizes blockchain and crypto to maintain its value, it is not a 
“crypto network”.  Any user, no matter their experience or comfort-level with 
crypto can use and reap rewards from the network. 

Competing with established social networks will not be easy, but with a reward 
system that is clear and demonstrated, there will be plenty of incentives for 
content creators (and those seeking great content) to find a new home.  And 
while the powerful, proven technology of the blockchain will power the 
transactions, that same technology will not need to be understood for the 
average person to use the system. 

The Organization will have three purposes- develop the software, provide and 
manage the infrastructure, and market the network.  While the technology and 
business model will be revolutionary, the team recognizes that a major 
marketing effort will be required to reach consumers and it is prepared to 
execute on that.  In addition, the Organization will be actively recruiting leading 
content creators to join the network. 

� !49



The Narrative platform will be developed by one of the most experienced teams 
in the online community space, with core technology available from Day One via 
a licensing deal with Social Strata, in order to jumpstart software development. 

The underlying technology will no doubt change and adapt over the years, but 
the central tenets of the system will remain- user autonomy, transparency, 
content ownership, and economic rewards, with the fundamental goal of putting 
users first in terms of management of the content and reaping the rewards of the 
system.

APPENDIX A 
TOKEN SALE BACKGROUND 

An important early milestone in the 
development of Narrative will be the 
usage of a Token Sale to help fund 
the initial development of the project.   
The Token Sale involves selling a 
certain percentage of “coins” (aka 
tokens) from the minting of the initial 
block of cryptocurrency tokens (called 
NRVE) for the platform.  Those tokens 
will function as a utility for the system, 
allowing funds in and out of the 
system to be tracked in a transparent 
manner. 

Token Sales are a relatively recent 
method of crowdfunding, but one 
that has become quite popular within 
the blockchain space.  The first token 
sale may have been by Mastercoin in 
2013.  So far in 2017, however, over 
$1.3 billion has been raised via the 
Token Sale process. In fact, in July 
alone, Token Sales raised over $300 
million, while traditional VS/angel 
investments amounted to just over 
$200 million2. 

Many governments throughout the 
world have yet to determine whether 
Token Sales should be regulated in 
some way. In the U.S., for instance, 

the SEC announced in July 2017 that 
that it may have authority to apply 
federal security laws to Token Sales, 
on a case-by-case basis.  Because of 
the uncertainty about U.S. imposing 
regulations in the future, many Token 
Sales exclude U.S. citizens from 
participating. 

Many companies choosing to offer 
Token Sales set up their operations in 
countries like Switzerland and 
Singapore, however Singapore has 
recently announced that it to will be 
considering some sort of regulation 
on Token Sales.   

In the U.S., it is important the Token 
Sale pass the “Howey Test”, which 
determines whether something 
should be classified as a security. If 
the underlying token of an Token Sale 
is considered a security, then 
government regulation should be 
expected. 

Some companies are looking to make 
Token Sales more regulation-proof by 
limiting investments to accredited 
investors only.  For instance, Filecoin, 
which recently raised over $250 

� !51

https://medium.com/bittrust/passing-the-howey-test-how-to-regulate-blockchain-tokens-d218da93a8b6


million in its Token Sale, limited its 
Token Sale participants to those who 
met the requirements for being an 
accredited investor3. 

Here is a listing of some significant 
Token Sales so far in 2017 (as of 
August 2017):  

Narrative will be seeking to raise approximately $25-30 million in its Token 
sale and has received a legal analysis that concludes that it should not be 
classified as a security, according to the Howey Test.

APPENDIX C 
RISK FACTORS FOR TOKEN SALE 
You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information 
contained in the Terms of Token Sale Documents (the “Terms”) before deciding to participate in the 
Narrative Token Sale (the “NTS”).  

To the best of Narrative’s (the “Company”) knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material to 
you in making an informed decision to participate in the NTS have been set out below. If any of the 
following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the business, 
financial position and/or results of operations of the Company and the maintenance and level of usage 
of the Narrative platform and the NRVE Tokens could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, 
the trading price of NRVE Tokens (in the case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could 
decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose all or part of 
your NTS Tokens. 

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN GENERATION EVENT 

There is no prior market for NRVE Tokens and the NTS may not result in an active or liquid market for the 
NRVE Tokens Prior to the NTS, there has been no public market for the NRVE Tokens. Although the 
Company will use reasonable endeavors to seek the approval for availability of the NRVE Tokens for 
trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that such approval will be obtained. 
Furthermore, even if such approval is granted by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that 
an active or liquid trading market for the NRVE Tokens will develop or if developed, be sustained after 
the NRVE Tokens have been made available for trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also 
no assurance that the market price of the NRVE Tokens will not decline below the original purchase price 
(the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative of the market price of the NRVE Tokens 
after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. 

A NRVE Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national 
organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. The Company is not responsible for nor 
does it pursue the circulation and trading of NRVE Tokens on the market. 

Trading of NRVE Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant market 
participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any NRVE Token from any holder of the NRVE Token, 
including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of NRVE Tokens to any 
extent at any time. 
  
Furthermore, NRVE Tokens may not be resold to purchasers where the purchase of NRVE Tokens may be 
in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company cannot ensure that there will be any demand 
or market for NRVE Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of NRVE Tokens 
after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. 

� !55



Future issuance of the NRVE Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of NRVE 
Tokens. Any future issuance of the NRVE Tokens would increase the supply of NRVE Tokens in the market 
and this may result in a downward price pressure on the NRVE Token. The sale or distribution of a 
significant number of NRVE Tokens outside of the NTS (including but not limited to the sales of NRVE 
Tokens undertaken after the completion of the initial token sale, issuance of NRVE Tokens to persons 
other than purchasers for purposes of community and employee initiatives, affiliate (or bounty) program 
development, academic research, education and market expansion and issuance of NRVE Tokens as a 
reward to employees and/or users of the Narrative platform), or the mere perception that such further 
sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the NRVE Tokens. 

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the NRVE Tokens.  Negative publicity 
involving the Company, the Narrative platform, the NRVE Tokens or any of the key personnel of the 
Company, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the NRVE 
Tokens, whether or not it is justified. 

We may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the future. There is no assurance that there will be 
any transaction volume such that you will receive any rewards anticipated to be distributed to active 
users of the Narrative platform. Further, even in the event there is substantial transaction volume and 
interactions among the users and the Narrative platform, there is no assurance you personally will 
receive any part of the rewards. This is because the ability of the Company to pay any reward to you will 
depend on the future results of operations and the future business and financial condition of the 
Company and there is no assurance of the future results of operations and the future business and 
financial condition of the Company. 

There is no assurance of any success of Narrative Platform or any Future Business Line. The value of, and 
demand for, the NRVE Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Narrative platform. There is no 
assurance that the Narrative platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial 
success. Although the Company will perform testing, including QA-testing of the Narrative platform, the 
Narrative platform has not been fully developed and finalized and is subject to further changes, updates 
and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its 
projected appeal to users, possibly due to the failure to meet users’ preconceived expectations based 
on the beta version, and hence impact its success. Limited usage of the Narrative platform could impact 
the public demand for the NRVE Tokens and correspondingly the trading price of the NRVE Tokens.  

The trading price of the NRVE Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Generation Event. The prices of 
cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short 
periods of time. The demand for, and corresponding the market price of, the NRVE Tokens may fluctuate 
significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond 
the control of the Company: 

(a) new technical innovations; 
(b) analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the NRVE Token’s market price 
or the Company’s financial and business performance; 
(c) changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with businesses similar to that of the 
Company that may be listed on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the NRVE Tokens; 

� !56



(d) announcements by the Company of significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new 
product developments; 
(e) fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges; 
(f) additions or departures of key personnel of the Company; 
(h) success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing business, development and growth 
strategies; 
(i) changes in conditions affecting the blockchain industry, the general economic conditions or market 
sentiments, or other events or factors. 

The funds raised in the Token Generation Event are exposed to risks of theft.  Further, upon receipt of 
the funds, the Company will make every effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely held 
through the implementation of security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no 
assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-
attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the NTS website, in the smart 
contract(s), if used, on which the escrow wallet and the NTS may rely, on NEO or any other blockchain, or 
otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to 
exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the NTS is completed, the Company may not be 
able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and may not be able to use such funds for the development 
of the Narrative platform and/or for launching the Narrative platform, including but not limited to the 
structuring and through developing of the Narrative platform. In such case, the launch of the Narrative 
platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed NRVE Tokens may hold 
little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price. 

RISKS RELATING TO NARRATIVE 

The Narrative platform is developed, operated and maintained by the Company. Any events or 
circumstances which adversely affect Narrative or any of its successor operating entities (collectively 
referred to herein as “Narrative”) may have a corresponding adverse effect on the Narrative platform. 
Such adverse effects would correspondingly have an impact on the utility, liquidity, and the trading price 
of the NRVE Tokens. 
  
Narrative may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its 
business develops and evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the Narrative 
platform. The social media technology and cryptocurrency industries, and the markets in which Narrative 
competes have grown rapidly over the past years and continue to evolve in response to new 
technological advances, changing business models and other factors. As a result of this constantly 
changing environment, Narrative may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the 
sustainability of Narrative will depend on its ability to manage its operations and ensure that it hires 
qualified and competent employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. As its business 
evolves, Narrative must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. Narrative’s business relies 
on its software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain 
technology and smart contract technology. All of these systems and tools represent complex, costly, and 
rapidly changing technical infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage 
technical support infrastructure for the Narrative platform, Narrative will need to continue to upgrade 
and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. 

� !57



These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and 
increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that Narrative does not control. If 
Narrative is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner 
to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition and results of operations may 
be adversely affected. If the third parties whom Narrative relies on are subject to a security breach or 
otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services Narrative uses, the integrity and availability of its 
internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or 
proprietary information, and economic loss. The loss of financial, labor or other resources, and any other 
adverse effect on Narrative’s business, financial condition and operations, would have a direct adverse 
effect on Narrative’s ability to maintain the Narrative platform. Any adverse effects affecting Narrative’s 
business or technology are likely to also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price of the 
NRVE Tokens. 

Narrative may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or 
software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect Narrative’s infrastructure 
network, and/or the Narrative platform. Narrative is not able to anticipate when there would be 
occurrences of hacks, cyber- attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in 
the Narrative platform, in the smart contracts, if used, or on NEO or any other blockchain technology. 
Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or 
abuse thereof. Narrative may not be able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of 
service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to 
efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession. 

Narrative’s network or services, which would include the Narrative platform, could be disrupted by 
numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, 
power losses, or even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software 
viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of which are beyond Narrative’s control. Although 
Narrative has taken steps against malicious attacks on its platform or its infrastructure, which are critical 
for the maintenance of the Narrative platform, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as 
distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, that Company’s enhanced security 
measures will be effective. Narrative may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal 
information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be 
damaging to the Company and/or holders of the NRVE Tokens. Any significant breach of the Company’s 
security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of 
the Narrative platform may adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price of the NRVE Tokens. 
The Company is dependent in part on the location and data center facilities of third parties. Narrative 
current infrastructure network is in part established through servers which it owns and houses at the 
location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If the 
Company is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, Narrative 
may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility, and may incur significant costs and 
possible service interruption in connection with the relocation.  

These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, 
arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third party 
providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action, employee error, 
malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers. 

� !58



As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and 
generally are not recognized until launched against a target, Narrative and the providers of such facilities 
may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any such 
security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon the Company’s infrastructure network and/
or the Narrative platform may adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the NRVE 
Tokens. 

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on Narrative. Operating 
performance, results of operations and cash flows Narrative has been and could continue to be affected 
by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have 
from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information 
technology industry at large. 

Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on the Company’s business, operations and 
financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows, and inability to attract 
future equity and/or debt financing on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, in a down-cycle 
economic environment, Narrative may experience the negative effects of a slowdown in trading and 
usage of the Narrative platform. Suppliers on which Narrative relies for servers, bandwidth, location and 
other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a 
negative impact on the Company’s operations or expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that 
current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession 
will not have a significant adverse impact on Narrative’s business, financial condition and results of 
operations and hence the Narrative platform. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly 
negatively impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the NRVE Tokens. 

The Company or the NRVE Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations. Cryptocurrency 
trading and NTS are generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory authorities across 
jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which 
govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. The Company or the  NRVE Tokens may be affected 
by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets, including 
having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, 
requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may 
also require substantial modifications to the Narrative platform. This may impact the appeal of the 
Narrative platform for users and result in decreased usage of the Narrative platform and the NRVE 
Tokens. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented 
regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the Narrative platform may no longer be 
commercially viable and the Company may opt to discontinue the Narrative platform and/or the NRVE 
Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may 
implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its 
applications, including the Narrative platform and the NRVE Tokens. Narrative may also have to cease 
operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially 
unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) or license(s) to operate in such 
jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the utility, liquidating, and/or trading price of NRVE 
Tokens will be adversely affected or NRVE Tokens may cease to be traded. 

� !59



There may be unanticipated risks arising from the NRVE Tokens. Cryptographic tokens such as the NRVE 
Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included in the above 
discussion of Risk Factors, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of the 
NRVE Tokens, including those that Narrative cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear as 
unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
