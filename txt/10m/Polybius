POLYBIUS TOKEN WHITEPAPER



1. eToken Contract as a basis for Polybius Token (PLBT)

PLBT is a token issued within an eToken1 contract. The number of Polybius tokens issued during 
the ICO equals 20,000,000 (twenty million). However, no further PLBT will be generated a�er 
this phase of the project and all the unsold tokens will be destroyed. 

eToken is an Ethereum smart contract, wri�en using Solidity2 programming language by 
Ambisafe3. It enables issuance of tokens in Ethereum network and provides a rich set of features:

1. Implementa�on of ICAP4 for mul�-layer transac�on rou�ng
2. Account recovery for the lost key scenario
3. Allowances
4. Automa�c ethereum network fee refunds
5. Integrated exchange with Ether currency
6. Ability to set transac�on fees

eToken also implements EIP205, also known as Standardized Contract API. EIP20 compa�bility 
ensures that integra�on with exchanges and other services will be no harder than for any other 
Ethereum-based token.

Concerns Breakdown

Polybius project consists of 3 layers of so�ware responsible for different concerns, as shown 
below:

Network-level Interac�on Diagram

Ethereum network provides a medium for interac�on between companies and users. Par�es 
interact by sending transac�ons to the Polybius contract. All transac�ons are validated by 
contract business logic and recorded in the blockchain. Contract API is open to all internet users 
and anyone can become a user of Polybius token.

System Architecture Overview

System-level Interac�on Diagram

The eToken protocol supports 2 primary account security models: user-side keys and hosted 
wallet.

User-side Keys

In this case, private key that unlocks account is known only to end-user.

Hosted Wallet

In this case, financial ins�tu�on (exchange or wallet provider) is responsible for key security. Only 
1-2 keys per ins�tu�on are used and transac�ons are routed to specific user accounts using ICAP6 
protocol.

The dividends distribu�on process consists of two stages: ge�ng the accurate data about the 
PLBT distribu�on among users (dividends report) and spreading the company profit among the 
tokenholders.

Dividends report

To have a proof of PLBT ownership by exact addresses, Polybius will make Snapshots of Blockchain 
prior each dividends distribu�on using a specially developed tool named Dividends Report. It 
allows to capture the current state of tokens distribu�on among investors as on the exact block. 
The number of the milestone block as well as an approximate date and �me of its appearance will 
be announced in advance both, by email and at the Polybius Website. 

Distribu�on of the profit 

Polybius Founda�on financial management undertakes to transfer 20% of the company 
distributable profit to the Dividends distribu�on smart contract on a yearly basis. The date of 
dividends distribu�on will be announced in advance at Polybius Bank Website. Also users will be 
no�fied via email twice. 

In order to receive their share of dividends, users will be required to return PLBT tokens to the   
Polybius Wallet or any other wallet which supports the dividends payment mode in case, if they 
have been stored outside of it. The list of such wallets will be announced at the Polybius Website. 

Polybius is nego�a�ng with all major exchanges regarding implementa�on of the dividends 
accep�ng func�onality. Polybius will inform customers whenever this feature will be available at 
any of them. 

A Dividends distribu�on smart contract is designed to distribute profit among the investors 
according to their stakes. All the payments will be made in ETH. Dividends will be sent to those 
addresses whose PLBT token ownership will be proved by Snapshot of Blockchain.
