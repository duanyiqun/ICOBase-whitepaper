Summary 

A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System1, published by Satoshi Nakmoto in 2008, 

has brought a whole new mode of thinking about decentralization. With the new mode 

of thinking, Fortuna, the first blockchain platform for the global OTC derivatives 

market, solves several core problems and introduces some new features as follows: 

1. Build a trust network. Fortuna can solve the trust problem of the OTC 

derivatives market with consensus algorithm DPOSA, structured smart contract, 

decentralized quote scheme, digitalized supervision and other techniques of blockchain.   

2. Improve the operational efficiency. As a specialized blockchain platform for 

derivatives, Fortuna can improve the operational efficiency of each step of transactions, 

including contract creation, price quoting, contract signature, trading and clearing. 

3. Increase the liquidity. As the only medium of exchange accepted by Fortuna, 

FOTA can enable the platform to embrace the global liquidity pool regardless of the 

physical and multi-currency barriers.  

4. Motivate users to trade. Fortuna supports two modes of trading: PrC and PuC. 

Under PrC mode, users can launch a peer to peer transaction without any cost of agency. 

Under PuC mode, users can create new types of derivatives and be the market makers 

while benefiting from the trading volume of the new derivatives created. 

5. Enrich the derivatives market. Users of Fortuna can create all kinds of 

derivatives with different underlying assets, deal structures, durations, margin ratios 

and other elements of transactions. To some extent, Fortuna can be a worldwide 

incubator for innovative derivative tools.  

6. Algorithmic regulation and self-discipline. With algorithmic regulation and 

self-discipline, Fortuna supports transparent, real time, and full dose data supervision. 

Smart contract, digitalized supervision, arbitration driven by consensus algorithm and 

other new technical features can inspire a new mode of regulation and self-discipline. 

As Herbert Marshall Mcluhan said, “we shape our tools and afterwards our tools 

shape us.” Fortuna will inspire a new mode of thinking for the global OTC derivatives 

market and make the tools of hedging more available and more popular.

1. Fortuna 

1.1 Current State of OTC Derivatives Market 

2010 is called the first year of hedging in China because securities margin trading 

and stock index futures were issued in this year, which concluded the age of one-sided 

stock market in China. As stock index futures, securities margin trading, Treasury bond 

futures, commodity options and other derivatives issued, many companies began the 

transition from traditional private equity companies to hedge funds adopting all kinds 

of investment strategies including long/short, macro, event driven, CTA, relative value 

and others. On the other hand, the volume of Chinese futures market reached 4 billion 

and the balance of securities margin financing reached 900 billion RMB. All the signs 

show that the derivatives market of China has entered a rapid development period. 

Moreover, as the data provided by FIA2 shows, Asia has become the biggest market in 2016.  

 

This chapter will analyze the current state of the derivatives market and introduce 

the solutions for three core problems of the OTC derivatives market. Moreover, three 

dimensional value-added innovations of Fortuna will be introduced and the meaning 

of blockchain technology for self-discipline and regulation will be analyzed. Finally, 

the business model and the economy design of Fortuna will be detailed in this chapter.

In spite of the high speed of development, the Chinese derivatives market still have 

many problems compared with the markets in America and Europe. 

1. Exchange Market: lack of derivatives varieties  

As the data provided by China Futures Association3 shows, there are only four 

futures exchanges and only 48 kinds of derivatives in exchange market in the first half 

year of 2017. The lack of derivatives varieties restrict the possibilities of more 

participation directly, and too many demands on derivatives are not satisfied.

Futures, 5-year Treasury Bond Futures, 10-year Treasury Bond 

Futures 

Furthermore, the unbalanced development of exchange market is obvious. For 

example, in the first half year of 2017, 5 kinds of derivatives (Steal Rebar, Bitumen, 

Zinc, Natural Rubber and Hot Rolled Coils) occupied 81% of total volume of Shanghai 

Futures Exchange and the other 9 kinds of derivatives occupied only 19%. Unbalanced 

development of exchange market implies that under the surface of rapid development, 

the Chinese exchange derivatives market is still not mature. 

2. OTC Market: credit risk and efficiency problem  

In 2013, China Futures Association issued Guide for Risk Management Service 

Carried by Subsidiaries Set up by the Futures Company4. Since then, many futures 

company in China began to set up subsidiaries to provide OTC derivatives service to 



 

4 
 

satisfy the requirements of risk management and price management in many areas. As 

OTC derivatives market in China is developing rapidly, the credit risk and trust problem 

become the key issue of the OTC market. On the other hand, although many institutions 

are trying to build an inter-institution OTC derivatives market, the lack of authoritative 

third party institution makes the inter-institution market loose and inefficient. 

3. Whole Market: unconnected with the overseas market and insufficient 

institutional investors 

As FIA 2016 Volume Survey2 shows, the derivatives exchanges of China performed 

well based on the volume dimension. 

 

However, the derivatives market in China are not connected with the international 

market very well for many reasons, such as the foreign exchange control policy. 

Moreover, the lack of professional institutional investors is another big problem. Since 

the first hedge fund was built in 1949, the market size of hedge fund has jumped from 

39.8 billion dollars to 3 trillion dollars. America market occupies 70%, Euro market 

occupies 20% and Chinese market only occupies 0.5%. The small market share shows 

the immature current state and the big room for growth in China.

1.2 Solutions for Three Core Problems 

There are four essential symbols of a mature financial market including a large pool 

of underlying financial assets, abundant derivatives, global liquidity participation and 

efficient regulation. Accompanying with the improving market maturity, the derivatives 

and risk management service will be in great demand. However, there are still three core 

problems need to be solved:  

1. How to build a trust network for OTC derivatives market. 

2. How to improve the operational efficiency of OTC derivatives market. 

3. How to increase the liquidity of OTC derivatives market. 

1.2.1 Build a Trust Network 

The trust problem and credit risk not only restrict the participation, but also limit 

the pool of liquidity. The difficulties to build trust within OTC derivatives market lead 

to three structural features of the OTC derivatives market as follows. 

1. The majority of participants are big intuitions with good credit records. The 

participation of small enterprises and individuals are rare. 

2. The nominal amount of single OTC derivative contract is very big in general and 

the duration of the contract is very long in general. 

3. The variety of OTC derivatives are not developed very well. 

The third problem seems to be strange because one of the advantages of OTC 

derivatives market is the feature of supporting personalized contract. However, the 

credit risk and the trust problem result in the prudent participation of investors especially 

when the traders fall under different jurisdiction. Therefore, the participants are not 

willing to take extra risk with personalized derivative contracts which may have 

complex deal structure and new underlying asset-class. As the data provided by BIS5 

shows, the notional principal reached 48.3 trillion dollars in 2016. The market share of 

currency derivatives (interest rate and FX derivatives) are more than 90%.  



 

6 
 

 

The reasons of the trust problem within OTC derivatives market are as follows. 

1. The participants of the OTC derivatives market come from different areas, such 

as finance, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. 

2. The regulation and self-discipline mechanism is not mature and complete. 

3. Traditional offline signature of contract will easily lead to disputation. 

4. Lack of default management mechanism without delay and human intervention. 

The reasons described above turn out to be the trust problem of the OTC derivatives 

market which cannot be solved easily in traditional ways. Fortuna introduces a whole 

new way to solve this problem based on blockchain technology as follows. 

1. Consensus Algorithm. Fortuna introduces an optimized version of consensus 

algorithm based on DPOS, which is called DPOSA to safeguard the data’s integrity and 

guarantee that it cannot be tampered with. As long as the malicious entities or nodes are 

no more than one third of the total number, there will be no fork and moral hazard. 

2. Smart Contract. Fortuna replaces the traditional offline contract signature mode 

with programmable and automatic executable smart contract based on the blockchain to 

eliminate the credit risk of derivatives trading activities. 

3. Digitalized Supervision. Fortuna introduces a new kind of crypto-token FOTA 

to unify the exchange media on the platform. All the participants from different areas 

and jurisdiction will trade derivatives using FOTA. The FOTA in margin account will 



 

7 
 

be supervised for 7*24 hour and no human being can intervene. The digitalized 

supervision mode based on crypto-token are much more efficient and transparent 

compared with the traditional supervision mode carried by commercial banks. 

4. Decentralized Quote Scheme. Fortuna creates a decentralized scheme for price 

quoting while introducing a mechanism similar to corporate equity governance to 

motivate the quoters to fulfill their duties and eliminate the possibilities of price 

manipulation.  

5. Arbitration Carried by Whole Network. If a trading node disagrees with the 

execution result of derivative contracts, it can apply for the arbitration carried by the 

whole network which can safeguard the equity of Fortuna. 

6. Lifelong Credit Record. Every node on Fortuna will have a lifelong credit 

record based on blockchain which can ensure the transparency, integrity and safety of 

the credit records. 

7. Self-disciplined by Algorithm. Fortuna is an ecological decentralized platform 

which consists of five functional roles including CoT maker, Trader, Quoter, Marker 

Maker and Delegate. All the definition, motivation and restriction setting of the five 

roles of Fortuna are based on algorithm instead of the rules on paper which can ensure 

the execution and the efficiency of self-discipline of the whole network.   

In conclusion, Fortuna will build a trust network for OTC derivatives market with 

consensus algorithm, smart contract, digitalized supervision, decentralized quote 

scheme, whole network arbitration, lifelong credit record, algorithmic self-discipline 

and other technical features. 

1.2.2 Improve Operational Efficiency 

Other than the credit risk and trust problem, the low operational efficiency of the 

OTC derivatives market is another core problem. For example, the process of OTC 

option transaction has 7 steps at least and requires manual operations in many steps, 

which turns out to be an inefficient process.  



 

8 
 

 

Therefore, one of the core problems of OTC derivatives market is the operational 

efficiency problem. Fortuna introduces a blockchain-based solution for this problem. 

1. Contract Creation and Signature. Fortuna introduces structured smart contract 

which is optimized to meet the demand of operational efficiency. There are three layers 

of the smart contract: main contract, contract template and contract. Lower layer of 

contract will inherit all the clauses of the contract in higher layer and each layer will set 

up their own class of clauses. Structured smart contract will improve the efficiency of 

the contract creation and signature step. 

2. Quote Broadcast on Blockchain. Fortuna replaces the traditional way of price 

quoting, which requires contact with every potential counterparty one by one through 

telephone or email, with broadcast on blockchain which can help to reduce the cost of 

communication and the response time. Moreover, the credit record of the trading node 

will be attached to the broadcast information which can improve the efficiency of 

transaction further. 

3. Automatic Settlement with Smart Contract. Fortuna utilizes the technical 

features of smart contract to improve the efficiency of transaction settlement step. 

Replacing manual settlement with programmable and automatic executable smart 

contract will shorten the time and reduce the potential errors.  

4. Data Supervision on Blockchain. Fortuna utilizes the technical features of 



 

9 
 

blockchain and decentralized network to improve the quality and efficiency of data 

supervision. For example, with Fortuna, there is no need for the regulator to send audit 

requirements to each institution while worrying about the quality, timeliness and 

veracity of data sent by institutions. 

In conclusion, Fortuna will improve the efficiency and quality of the work such as 

contract creation and signature, price quoting, transaction settlement and data 

supervision based on the technical features of blockchain and the optimization of smart 

contract technology. 

1.2.3 Increase the Liquidity 

The third core problem of OTC derivatives market is the liquidity problem due to 

three factors as follows. 

1. The foreign exchange control policy restricted the connection between Chinese 

market and international market. 

2. The personalized contract is hard for secondary trading in nature. 

3. The lack of trust limited the number of participants which restrict the liquidity 

of the whole OTC derivatives market. 

Fortuna introduces a solution for this problem based on blockchain technology. 

1. Unify the Exchange Media with Crypto-token FOTA. Fortuna introduces a 

new kind of crypto which is called FOTA to unify the exchange media on the platform. 

All the participants around the world should trade derivatives using FOTA on Fortuna 

regardless of the physical and multi-currency barriers. 

2. Support PrC and PuC Trading Mode. Fortuna not only introduces a structured 

smart contract with three layers, but also supports two kinds of trading mode: PrC and 

PuC. PrC Mode will enable every trading node of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer 

derivative transaction without any cost of agency. PuC Mode offer opportunities for 

every node of Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market for a new type of 

derivative which can bring profit for the creator related to the trading volume of the new 

derivative contract. PuC is similar to the standardized contracts traded in exchanges 

which have better liquidity. The biggest difference between PuC and the exchange-



 

10 
 

traded contract is that the exchange-traded contract is designed and issued by exchange, 

but on Fortuna, every node could design and issue any kinds of derivative contract on 

their demand. 

1.3 Three Dimensional Innovations 

Other than providing solutions for the three core problems of OTC derivatives 

market, Fortuna can also make a difference through three dimensional innovations for 

OTC derivatives market as follows. 

1. Support more precise and specific derivatives on a smaller granularity level. 

2. Support new class of underlying assets. 

3. Support more participants to utilize hedging as a scientific risk management tool.  

1.3.1 Smaller Granularity Level 

The majority of the derivatives are designed for the majority of the participants. 

However, many investors need some derivatives on smaller granularity level to manage 

their risk more precise and more specifically. For example, S&P 500 index futures are 

good for majority of the investors, but there are still a lot of demand on making S&P 

500 a smaller index so that investors can take more targeted hedging strategy to manage 

the risk of their portfolios.  

Furthermore, the factors that can affect the price of underlying assets are abundant 

and investors may have more precise prediction and analysis on these single factor rather 

than the price of the underlying asset. For example, a company occupied in international 

trade between China and America. The CEO of the company predicted that Trump 

would be the president of U.S. and he believed that the result could affect the foreign 

exchange rates and the international trades. However, the only way he could manage the 

risk in the finical market is to trade foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk, but 

there are some problems with this way. 

First of all, the reaction chain is too long. Take the international trade company as 

an example, the result of the presidential election can determine whether Trump has the 

right to name a new chairman of Fed. The new chairman of Fed can affect the monetary 



 

11 
 

policy which can impact the foreign exchange rate further. The reaction chain is too long 

which leads to a lower precision of hedging.  

Second, other than the presidential election, there are too many factors affecting 

the foreign exchange which means even if the CEO predicts the election result correctly, 

he may not benefit from the derivatives trading in the financial market.  

Third, the presidential election will not only affect the foreign exchange but also 

the tariff policy and other policies that will affect the international trades between China 

and America. The CEO can trade the foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk for 

the assets accumulated in history. However, there is no vehicles in traditional market for 

him to hedge the risk of the whole business of international trades in the future. 

As for the three problems described above, Fortuna supports new types of 

derivatives on a smaller granularity level which can enable investors or hedgers to trade 

derivatives on single factor such as the monetary policy, tariff policy, presidential 

election, etc. New type of derivatives on a smaller granularity level will be a new way 

for investors to hedge the risk more precisely. 

1.3.2 New Underlying Assets 

The majority of traditional underlying assets of derivatives are commodity and 

financial securities. However, as all kinds of areas permeated with internet and 

technique, there are many new classes of assets coming into being and the derivatives 

for the risk management will definitely be developed afterwards.  

For example, thousands of crypto-tokens around the world based on blockchain 

technology has been popular for several years. There is a great demand on the 

derivatives for the crypto-tokens. Actually, the CME has just announced that it will 

publish the BTC futures officially.  

For example, micro-amount consumer finance through the internet is developing 

rapidly in the last few years around the world. The derivatives for the credit assets 

accumulated by those internet consumer finance companies are necessary and important.  

As the new technology developed, there will be more and more scenarios and cases 

just like the examples above. The derivatives and risk management will be on great 



 

12 
 

demand in those areas afterwards. And Fortuna will enable every node throughout the 

blockchain to create new types of derivatives with new types of underlying assets which 

will make the OTC derivatives market a whole new market in the future. 

1.3.3 Higher Availability of Hedging 

Traditional derivatives markets are not friendly to many investors for two reasons 

as follows. 

First of all, high threshold of financial knowledge. The majority of investors are 

not familiar with the derivatives market because of the complex deal structures and 

professional terms. However, the demand for risk management shows everywhere for 

every investor even if they don’t realize and being blocked by the high threshold of 

financial knowledge.  

Second, high requirement of initial deposit. Take the stock index futures of China 

as an example, the initial account deposit requirement is 500,000 RMB which turns out 

to be a high requirement for the majority of investors in China. Although a high 

requirement of initial deposit is an effective way to protect the investors by blocking 

them out, there will be another way to protect the investors while enabling them to utilize 

the derivatives to hedge their risk. 

As for the higher threshold of financial knowledge and initial deposit, Fortuna 

supports more friendly vehicles for risk management through lowering the requirement 

of initial deposit, simplifying the deal structure, standardizing contract clauses, 

introducing new asset class and other effective means. Fortuna can make more and more 

investors know and get used to hedging for risk management. 

1.4 Blockchain for Supervision 

A sophisticated regulation system and self-discipline mechanism is a necessary 

condition for mature financial market. As a new technology, blockchain could provide 

a whole new way for supervision.  

1. Build a self-disciplined community based on blockchain. Fortuna creates an 

ecosystem with five functional roles including CoT Maker, Trader, Quoter, Market 



 

13 
 

Maker and Delegate. The ecosystem is balanced through role definition, interaction and 

motivation design which is based on FOTA as a tool for punishment and reward. 

Furthermore, the whole self-disciplined mechanism is programmable and automatic 

executable based on algorithm.    

2. Data supervision. Fortuna supports transparent, real time, and full dose trading 

data supervision based on blockchain. Moreover, there is no need for regulation 

department to send audit and data requirement to each institution and worrying about 

the quality, timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by different institutions. 

Fortuna can create a new approach to improve the quality and efficiency of data 

supervision of OTC derivatives market.  

3. Inspiration for regulation. The new features of structured smart contract, 

digitalized trading fund supervision, arbitration driven by consensus algorithm and other 

core features of Fortuna could bring a lot of inspirations for the current regulation 

scheme of OTC derivatives market. 

4. Lifelong credit record. Based on blockchain technology, Fortuna will record 

every node’s behavior information including price quoting, contract execution, default, 

arbitration, etc. The credit record will be safeguarded, lifelong and transparent to the 

whole blockchain. 

Fortuna will utilize and optimize the core technical features of blockchain to offer 

tools and inspirations for the regulation and self-discipline mechanism for OTC 

derivatives market. 

1.5 Economic Model of Fortuna 

First and foremost, as an open source project based on blockchain, Fortuna is 

owned by every nodes of the chain. Moreover, Fortuna will not charge any nodes for 

any kinds of fee and all the potential fee will be charged by nodes offering different 

kinds of services. Fortuna will introduce a utility-based crypto token, FOTA, which will 

be used as the exchange media for the derivatives trading. The total amount of FOTA 

will be 1 billion. 

For example, there is a Contract Template created by a CoT maker and the CoT set 



 

14 
 

its transaction fee standard. All the transaction fee from the concreate contracts 

produced by this CoT will be distributed to three type of serving nodes:  

Node Type Description 

CoT Maker 

CoT maker could benefit from the commission of the contract 

created and traded under the CoT（Contract Template）. 

Quoter 

Quoter on Fortuna will get FOTA based on their shares of quoter 

corporation providing price quoting service for trading activities. 

Delegate 

101 delegates elected by whole network each round based on 

DPOSA consensus algorithm will get a certain percentile of the 

commission from the contract stored in the blocks which is produced 

by delegates. 

Moreover, there are many kinds of roles on Fortuna could make profit through the 

decentralized platform and this all-win mechanism design would be beneficial for the 

sustainable development of Fortuna.  

Roles Sources of Profit 

Delegate 

Fortuna will newly issue 1% of whole FOTA as a reward for all 

the delegates producing blocks to store data. 

Market Maker 

Under the PuC trading mode, every node could be a market 

maker to earn the bid-ask spread in FOTA. 

FVLS 

FVLS nodes will provide FOTA value locking service for the 

trading nodes to ensure that the FOTA value compared with other 

crypto-tokens or currencies will be the same during the contract 

period. FVLS will be a good tool for risk management and FVLS 

nodes will charge for it.

definition, decentralized quote scheme and the life cycle of PrC/PuC contracts are 

detailed. DPOSA is discussed as an optimized version of DPOS consensus algorithm. 

The meaning of FVLS is analyzed and the compliance filtering scheme is given in 

the last part. 



 

16 
 

such as lowering the technical threshold, improving developing efficiency, automatic 

iteration, etc. However, Fortuna still choose to build a complete blockchain from scratch 

because an optimized and independent blockchain will be more appropriate for the 

global OTC derivatives market which needs eight core features at least as follows.

2.1.2 Core Component Layer 

The core component layer of Fortuna consists of structured smart contract, role 

definition and decentralized quote scheme. 

1. Structured Smart Contract 

In order to meet the special requirements of OTC derivatives market, Fortuna 

introduces structured smart contract with three layers including main contract layer, CoT 

(contract template) layer and contract layer. The structured smart contract design can 

improve the operational efficiency for contract creation, matching, signature and 

clearing by reducing the repetitive work. Moreover, there are two kinds of contract at 

the contract layer: PrC (Private Contract) and PuC (Public Contract). PrC trading mode 

will enable every user of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer derivative contract transaction 



 

17 
 

without any transaction cost. PuC trading mode offers opportunities for every user of 

Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market for a new type of derivative 

which can bring profit for the creator related to the trading volume of the new derivative. 

2. Role Definition and Interaction Design 

Fortuna builds a healthy ecosystem through the role definition and interaction 

design. There are five functional roles of Fortuna which are CoT maker, Trader, Quoter, 

Market Maker and Delegate. Based on the motivation design with FOTA and the 

cooperation mechanism design of the five roles, the decentralized system for OTC 

derivative market can develop in a healthy and sustainable way. 

3. Decentralized Quote Scheme 

As a decentralized network for OTC derivatives market based on blockchain 

technology, Fortuna needs to support price quoting service which can provide the price 

of underlying assets for settlement and clearing of derivatives contracts. All the nodes 

on Fortuna can be a quoter node after the QNS (Quote Name Service) verification. Every 

quoter needs to be a member of a QC (Quote Corporation) in order to provide the price 

quoting service of some kinds of underlying assets. Every quoter has equities of a QC 

and will benefit from the profit of QC based on the equities owned. Moreover, an equity 

redistribution mechanism is introduced for motivating all the quoter nodes to fulfill their 

duties and prohibiting the exit scam8 risk. 

2.1.3 Platform Service Layer 

1. CoT Creation 

All the nodes on Fortuna can create its own CoT (contract template) and the CoT 

needs to confirm the underlying asset, deal structure and other elements of transaction. 

A CoT creator needs to deposit some FOTA to guarantee that it will not do something 

that is harmful for other nodes and the whole platform, such as creating a lot of useless 

CoT. A CoT creator will benefit from the commission related to the trading volume of 

the contracts under the CoT.   

2. PrC Trading 

Fortuna introduces a PrC (Private Contract) trading mode which will enable every 



 

18 
 

user of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer derivative transaction without any cost of 

agency. A PrC should define the settlement time, delivery price, margin ratio, price of 

derivative, short or long position and other elements of transaction.  

3. PuC Trading 

Fortuna introduces a PuC (Public Contract) trading mode which can offer 

opportunities for every user of Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market 

for a new type of derivative contract which can bring profit for the creator related to the 

trading volume of the new contract. A PuC should define the settlement time, delivery 

price, margin ratio, price of derivative, market maker and other elements of transaction.  

4. Market Making 

A PuC will choose a node to be the market maker for itself and the market maker 

can earn the bid-ask spread from the market making activities. On the other hand, a 

market maker needs to deposit some FOTA to guarantee that it can provide liquidity for 

the market. 

5. Price Quoting 

A lot of Quote Corporations will provide price quoting service of underlying assets 

for the settlement of derivatives transaction in OTC market and will charge for service. 

All the quoters of a quoter corporation will benefit from the whole profit of the 

corporation based on the equities owned by quoters.  

6. FVLS 

As a decentralized platform for hedging, the most important meaning of Fortuna is 

help investors to manage the risk of their portfolio. FOTA, as the only exchange medium 

of Fortuna, can help Fortuna to embrace the international liquidity regardless of physical 

and multi-currency barriers. However, the fluctuation of the value of FOTA will post a 

negative influence on the efficiency of risk management which will damage the meaning 

of hedging. Therefore, Fortuna introduces a kind of service which is called FVLS (FOTA 

value locking service). FVLS can help users to trade derivatives without the influence 

of the fluctuation of FOTA value and Fortuna will charge for FLVS at a reasonable level.

2.1.4 Application Layer 

In order to provide great user experience, Fortuna will publish different versions of 

wallet and platform for PC, web and mobile phones to satisfy users’ requirements about 

security, efficiency and availability. In addition, a light application allows users only 

need to download the head of the block instead of the whole block while supporting 

secure block access for user to create a CoT/PrC/PuC and trade the derivatives on 

Fortuna.  

2.2 Fortuna Ecosystem 

The whole ecosystem of Fortuna is as follows.  

 

The whole ecosystem of Fortuna is built on Fortuna blockchain and three core 

components including structured smart contract, decentralized quote scheme, role 

definition and interaction design.  

A CoT Maker can create all kinds of contract templates under the unified main 

contract. The CoT created will define the underlying asset, the deal structure and the 

chosen Quote Corporation. A Contract Trader can create a PrC and search for the 

counterparty to trade. Alternatively, a Contract Trader can create a PuC under a CoT to 

launch long or short trading activities with other nodes. A Quoter of a Quote Corporation 



 

20 
 

can provide price quoting service for one kind of underlying asset and the quoted price 

would be the basis for settlement of transactions. A Market Maker will provide liquidity 

for the PuC and the delegates elected by DPOSA consensus algorithm will produce 

blocks for storing data. Fortuna will develop in a healthy and sustainable way through 

the cooperation of all the roles and the motivation design based on FOTA as the 

punishment or reward. 

2.3 Structured Smart Contract

The structured smart contract of Fortuna is as follows. 

 

1. Fortuna Main Contract 

The Fortuna Main Contract is the only main contract accepted by Fortuna and the 

clauses are similar to the main contract of NAFMII, SAC and other self-regulatory 

organization for OTC derivatives. Every trader on Fortuna will sign the main contract 

before they start trading activities and will come to an agreement about the constitution 

of contracts, efficacy level of contracts, duty of payment and delivery, definition of 

default, default management, definition of termination, interest, compensation, expense, 

arbitration and other non-transactional elements. 

2. Contract Template 

A Contract Template is called CoT and all the users of Fortuna can create their own 

CoT with different underlying assets (commodities, currencies, bonds, stocks, credit 

assets, crypto-tokens, events, etc.), deal structures (forwards, swaptions, American 

Options, European Options, LMSR9, etc.), restrictive clauses and other core elements 

of transactions. Every CoT can produce a lot of contracts. 

Fortuna Main Contract

Contract Template 1

PrC1 PrC2 PuC3 PuC4

CoT 2

PrC1 PuC2 PrC3

CoT 3

PuC1 PuC2 Prc3

...

...



 

21 
 

3. PrC 

A Private Contract is called PrC and a PrC is a kind of derivative contract which is 

appropriate for peer to peer trading mode. PrC will inherit all the clauses of the 

corresponding CoT and will define the settlement time, delivery price, margin ratio, 

contract price, short/long direction and other elements of transaction. PrC has 

disadvantages of liquidity and matching efficiency, but it has the advantages of peer to 

peer trading and lower cost of agencies. 

4. PuC 

A Public Contract is called PuC and a PuC is a kind of derivative contract which is 

appropriate for N to N trading mode requiring the participation of market makers. The 

creator of the corresponding CoT is the market maker in default unless the creator 

choose another node to be the market maker for the PuC under the CoT. PuC will inherit 

all the clauses of the corresponding CoT and will define the settlement time, delivery 

price, margin ratio, contract price and other elements of transactions. PuC is very similar 

to the contracts traded in the derivatives exchange. However, the biggest difference 

between them is that the standardized contracts traded in exchange is designed and 

published by exchanges and no users can make changes. On the contrary, PuC are 

designed and created by users of Fortuna. Another big difference is that the commission 

of the standardized contracts traded in exchange is all for the exchanges while the 

commission of PuC will all belong to the CoT Creators. Therefore, although the PuC 

has the feature of great liquidity with market making, the PuC is a new type of derivative 

contract compared with the contracts traded at exchanges. 

2.4 Role Definition 

Five kinds of roles of Fortuna are as follows. 

1. CoT Maker 

 All the users could create their own CoT while defining the deal structure and 

underlying assets at liberty. 

 A CoT Maker needs to assign a quote corporation to provide the price quoting 

service of the chosen underlying asset. 



 

22 
 

 A CoT Maker will benefit from the trading volume of the contracts under the 

CoT. This kind of mechanism will motivate CoT Maker nodes to create reasonable and 

popular CoT to gain more profits. 

 A CoT Maker needs to deposit a certain amount of FOTA to guarantee that it 

will not damage the ecosystem of Fortuna, such as creating a lot of useless CoT. 

2. Contract Trader 

 All the users with FOTA can trade all kinds of derivatives on Fortuna to 

manage the risk of portfolio. 

 All the users can choose a CoT and create a corresponding PrC or PuC to 

define all kinds of elements of transaction. 

 All the users can trade with other users at a trust network based on blockchain 

technology. 

 All the contract traders should deposit a certain amount of FOTA according to 

the margin ratio required by contracts.  

3. Price Quoter 

 All the users can apply to be a Quoter. 

 A node can be a quoter only if it can pass the QNS verification (Quote Name 

Service, verify the efficiency of the interface provided by the quoter node for price 

quoting). 

 A quoter node must attend at least one Quote Corporation to start providing 

price quoting services and pay a certain amount of FOTA for the equities of Quote 

Corporation. 

 All the contracts will invoke a price quoting service provided by a Quote 

Corporation and a Quote Corporation will produce a Quote Matrix to calculate the final 

result through the SVD consensus algorithm. 

 A Quoter will gain its proportion of profits of the corresponding Quote 

Corporation based on the equities owned. 

 The equities of a Quote Corporation will redistribute based on the behaviors 

of the quoters of this Quote Corporation. 



 

23 
 

 A Quoter can sell its equities back to the corresponding Quote Corporation for 

FOTA when the quoter quit. 

4. Market Maker 

 Provides market making service for a PuC and needs to deposit a certain 

amount of FOTA as a margin. 

 Market Maker makes profits through the bid-ask spread of market making. 

 The creator of the corresponding CoT will be market maker in default. 

5. Delegate 

 A delegate can produce blocks as well as keep trading records. For each block 

produced, the delegate will be rewarded with a certain amount of FOTA. 

 There are a total of 101 delegates in the whole network, which are elected 

based on the DPOSA algorithm. 

 Until the contracts and quotes are written into the block, a delegate cannot view 

their contents. 

2.5 Decentralized Quoting Scheme 

The Quoting mechanism, a mechanism providing the current market price of 

underlying assets, needs to minimize risks from malicious entities and provide adequate 

incentives for quoters to post high-quality quotes at the same time. Fortuna is equipped 

with an SVD-based decentralized quoting mechanism that can prevent market 

manipulation from a small number of malicious entities in an effective way. In the 

meantime, it introduces “Quote Corporation”, which uses an incentive scheme that is 

analogous to corporate governance and equity redistribution, motivating quoters to 

provide high-quality quotes continuously. The detail mechanism is described below:   

2.5.1 The Overall Scheme 

The overall scheme of Fortuna’s decentralized quoting mechanism is as follows: 



 

24 
 

 

1. Joining a Quote Corporation 

Every node in the network can become a quoter once certified by QNS (Quote 

Name Service). A quoter needs to join one or more Quote Corporation (QC) before it 

can post any quotes. A quoter can query the FQCT catalogue to find and join QCs that 

match the category of quoting services it provides. If no such QC exists, a QC of the 

new category will be automatically created. 

2. Quote Corporation provide quoting services 

In a certain cycle, when multiple smart contracts that using the same QC’s quoting 



 

25 
 

service matures, the quoters in this QC will provide independent quotes. The QC will 

compile a quote matrix using all the quotes provided for each underlying asset by all the 

quoters and obtain a consensus price using the SVD consensus algorithm. This 

consensus price will be used for contract fulfillment. The details of the SVD consensus 

algorithm will be described in later sections. 

3. Dynamic redistribution of Quote Corporation equity 

After each cycle, the consensus algorithm will determine the consensus quote as 

well as every quoter’s impact weight in this cycle, which is used as an indicator of the 

quality of its quotes. Then the QC will set aside a certain amount of equity as to 

redistribute among all quoters according to their impact weights, motivating them to 

provide high-quality quotes actively. This equity redistribution mechanism will be 

detailed in later sections.   

2.5.2 SVD-Based Consensus Algorithm 

In each cycle, for a quote corporation that has n quoters and m underlying assets, a 

n by m quote matrix will be constructed by collecting all the quotes posted by every 

quoter for every underlying asset. The quote matrix is illustrated below.   

 



 

26 
 

QC：a Quote Corporation 

𝑄𝑥：the quotes provided by the x-th quoter 

𝐸𝑦：the quotes received by the y-th underlying asset 

𝑆𝑥
𝑄𝐶：the equity share possessed by the x-th quoter 

𝐶𝑜𝑇𝑘：the k-th contract template  

In the quote matrix above, each row corresponds to the quotes provided by a quoter 

to the m underlying assets and each column corresponds to the quotes received by the n 

quoters for an underlying asset. An SVD algorithm is applied on the quote matrix 𝑄n×𝑚 

to determine the consensus quotes and the impact weight of each quoter as follows. 

Assume that there are k eigenvalues of 𝑄n×𝑚， 𝜆k represents the k-th eigenvalues, 

𝑥𝑘 represents the k-th column of 𝑄n×𝑚: 

𝑄n×𝑚𝑥1 =  𝜆1𝑥1 

𝑄n×𝑚𝑥2 =  𝜆2𝑥2 

𝑄n×𝑚𝑥3 =  𝜆3𝑥3 

… 

𝑄n×𝑚𝑥𝑘 =  𝜆𝑘𝑥𝑘 

Then we can have: 

𝑈 = [𝑥1, 𝑥2  𝑥3, … 𝑥𝑘] 

𝛬 =
𝜆1 … 0
⋮ ⋱ ⋮
0 … 𝜆𝑘

 

𝑄𝑛×𝑚 ∙ 𝑈 =  𝑈 ∙ 𝛬 

Then we can calculate the eigen decomposition of 𝑄n×𝑚: 

𝑄n×𝑚 = 𝑈 ∙ 𝛬 ∙ 𝑈
−1 = 𝑈 ∙ 𝛬 ∙ 𝑈𝑇 

Assume there is a group of orthogonal basis {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3 … 𝑣𝑛}: 

𝑄n×𝑚𝑣𝑖 ∙ 𝑄n×𝑚𝑣𝑗 = (𝑄n×𝑚𝑣𝑖)
𝑇 ∙ 𝑄n×𝑚𝑣𝑗 =  𝑣𝑖

𝑇𝑄n×𝑚
𝑇 ∙ 𝑄n×𝑚𝑣𝑗 = 0 



 

27 
 

Which means 𝑣𝑖
𝑇 ∙ 𝑣𝑗 = 𝑣𝑖 ∙ 𝑣𝑗 = 0 

Then 

𝑢𝑖 =
𝑣𝑖

|𝐴𝑣𝑖|
 

So we can have 

𝑄n×𝑚[𝑣1 𝑣2 𝑣3 … 𝑣𝑘|𝑣𝑘+1 … 𝑣𝑛] = [𝑢1 𝑢2 𝑢 … 𝑢𝑘|𝑢 … 𝑢𝑛] 

Finally 

𝑄𝑛×𝑚 = 𝑈𝛴𝑉
𝑡 

As 

𝑆𝑉𝐷(𝑄𝑛×𝑚) = 𝑈𝑚×𝑚 × 𝛴𝑚×𝑛 × 𝑉𝑛×𝑛
∗  

We can have 

𝑑𝑚×1 = 𝑈,1 we take the first row of 𝑈 

Centralize 𝑄𝑛×𝑚 which means calculate the mean value of each column of 𝑄𝑛×𝑚  

𝜇𝑛×𝑚 = 𝐽𝑛×1 ∙ 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛1×𝑚(𝑄𝑛×𝑚) 

𝑉𝑛×𝑚
𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 𝑄𝑛×𝑚  −  𝜇𝑛×𝑚 

𝑐𝑛×1 = 𝑉𝑛×𝑚
𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 × 𝑑𝑚×1 

After normalization, each item of 𝑐𝑛×1 is positive and the weighed sum equals 1. 

𝑁𝜒 =  
|𝜒|

∑ |𝜒|
 

Finally we can get 𝑁𝜒 which is the weight of the current result of 𝑄𝜒. 

Based on this, we can get the consensus quotes of a Quote Matrix 𝑄n×𝑚 for the 

settlement of transactions. 

2.5.3 QC Equity Governance and Redistribution 

QC equity can be bought by a quoter upon joining a QC. Correspondingly, it can 

also be sold upon exiting a QC. However, in order to ensure its integrity of an incentive 

for providing high-quality quotes, no QC equity is allowed to be traded between quoters. 

The only channel for it to flow between quoters is through the dynamic redistribution 



 

28 
 

after each cycle, which is based on the quality and frequency of the quotes provided by 

each quoter – a quoter with better performance will be rewarded with more equity. 

Below are the detailed rules for the redistribution:

29

𝑂𝑌：quoter Y exits the QC 

𝐶𝑍：the Z-th cycle of the consensus algorithm  

𝑀：the amount FOTA that needs to be paid to join the QC 

𝑁𝑄𝐶：the number of quoters in the QC before the update 

𝑁𝑄𝐶′：the number of quoters in the QC after the update 

𝐶𝑄𝐶：the total amount of funds in the QC before the update 

𝐶𝑄𝐶′：the total amount of funds in the QC after the update 

𝑆𝑋
𝑄𝐶：the fraction of equity shares possessed by quoter X before the update 

𝑆𝑋
𝑄𝐶 ‘：the fraction of equity shares possessed by quoter X after the update 

𝛷：the fraction of equity shares used for redistribution after each cycle 

𝑊𝑋
𝑍：the impact weight of quoter X after the Z-th cycle 

Below is a case example to help illustrate the rules described above: 

Suppose 𝑀 = 1000𝐹𝑂𝑇 and 𝛷 = 20% 

1. Quoter A paid 1000 FOTA to set up a new QC for a certain category of 

underlying assets. And it owns 100% of the QC’s equity shares. 

2. Quoter B paid 1000 FOTA to join the QC. Quoters A and B now each owns 50% 

of total equity shares. 

3. Quoter C paid 1000 FOTA to join and quoters A, B and C each owns one third 

of the total shares. 

4. Quoter D also paid 1000 FOTA to join. Now A, B, C and D each owns 25% of 

the total shares. 

5. Suppose at the end of cycle, quoters A, B, C and D ended up with impact weights 

of 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%, respectively. After the redistribution, their equity share 

percentages became 25%×(1-20%)+20%×40%=28%, 25%×(1-20%)+20%×30%=26%, 

25%×(1-20%)+20%×20%=24% and 25%×(1-20%)+20%×10%=22%. 



 

30 
 

6. Quoter A exits the QC. Upon the exit, all of its equity shares would be bought 

back by the QC. Because the QC had a total fund of 4000 FOTA (paid by A, B, C and 

D upon their entry), the shares of A would be sold for 4000×28% = 1120 FOTA. These 

shares would be released to quoters B, C and D proportionally. In the end, the fraction 

of equity shares owned by B, C and D would be 36%, 33% and 31%. 

2.5.4 Continuous Quoting and Close Out Alert 

There are two types of quotes that a quoter can provide in terms of the contract 

trading structure: discrete and continuous. Under certain trading structure, the trading 

contract requires continuous quoting service in order to monitor the deposit accounts of 

both parties in real time and issue alert when they need close out. Therefore, Fortuna 

will rigorously scrutinize quoters who provide continuous quoting services to make sure 

they can provide robust and continuous services continuously. See the details in the 

figure below: 

 

A quoter who provides continuous quoting/close out/alert services needs to closely 

monitor if there is any active contract that requires alert/close out. Let us call such a 

quoter QX. Below is how QX functions: 



 

31 
 

1. QX provides various types of continuous real-time services including 

registration, notification, real-time inquiry, close out check, etc; 

2. QX will check if the current block contains deals that need to be alerted for close 

out and write them into the local contract list; 

3. QX node will inquire third-party prices in real-time and compare with the alerted 

close out prices in the local contracts. If the alert/close out condition applies, the 

alert/close out will be executed immediately; 

4. The deposit requirement can dramatically increase the cost of malicious 

activities and potentially minimize them. 

2.6 Contract Life Cycle 

Depending on their types, contracts have different life cycles. This section will 

describe the life cycles of PrC and PuC in detail. 

2.6.1 Life Cycle of PrC 

PrC is useful for 1 to 1 or 1 to N customized contracts, its life cycle is shown in the 

picture below: 

 

1. CoT Created: A contract template is created by the CoT maker, specifying the 

anchored underlying assets, deal structure and quote corporation. The template is 

submitted and will be written into a block. Until then, the template is be invisible. 

Phase Ⅷ：PrC Mature

Phase Ⅶ：Clearing

Phase Ⅵ：Audit

Phase Ⅴ：Quote

Phase Ⅳ：PrC Signed

Phase Ⅲ：Broadcast

Phase Ⅱ：PrC Created

Phase Ⅰ：CoT Created



 

32 
 

2. PrC Created: Based on the template, a trader will create a concrete PrC, which 

defines various key elements of the deal such as the delivery time, deal price, unit, 

deposit percentage, contract price, trading direction, etc. The contract is submitted and 

written into a block. Until then, the contract is invisible, which is similar to creating a 

PrC contract template. Please see the figure below for illustration. 

 

3. Broadcast: Inquiry and quoting are done by broadcasting over the whole 

network. Parties who are interested in the contract will respond to the broadcast. Inquiry 

will be broadcasted if the trading direction is specified as “buy-in” and quoting will be 

broadcasted if the trading direction is specified as “sell-out”.  

4. PrC Signed: A party responds to the broadcast and signs the contract with its 

creator. Then both parties pay a certain amount of contract fee as well as deposits, which 

enacts the contract effectively. 

5. Quote: Upon the delivery date specified in the PrC contract, the contract will 

utilize the quote corporation specified in its template and inquires the price for the 

corresponding underlying assets. The quote corporation will determine a consensus 

result based on the SVD algorithm and provide it for the contract fulfillment.  



 

33 
 

6. Audit: Both parties of the deal needs to confirm and agree on the contract 

fulfillment conditions. If either party refuses the conditions, it can request for an audit 

by all the nodes in the network. In this case, price inquiry will be done by all the nodes 

instead of the QC. Note that, the party who requested the audit will pay a certain amount 

of audit fee. However, if the audit is successful, the audit fee will be covered by the QC. 

7. Clearing: After both parties confirmed the contract fulfillment conditions, they 

will clear the deal by paying off their balances. The deposits will be refunded to them 

after that.  

8. PrC Mature: Upon the clearing, the contract finishes its life cycle. In the 

meantime, Fortuna will keep a record of the behaviors of all relevant entities of this 

contract, which can be used to construct a credit database. 

2.6.2 Life Cycle of PuC 

PuC contracts are useful for N to N risk hedging deals and require market makers 

in the deal. Their life cycles are very similar to those of PrC contracts, with some 

differences in the 3rd and 4th phases. The 3rd and 4th phases of a PrC are broadcasting 

of inquiry/quoting and contract signing which are suitable for direct signing the 1 to 1 

or 1 to N customized contracts. However, the 3rd and 4th phases of a PuC provide initial 

liquidity of market makers and open the floor for whole network trading, which is 

essentially an N to N market maker trading mode. 

 
Phase Ⅷ：PuC Mature

Phase Ⅶ：Clearing

Phase Ⅵ：Audit

Phase Ⅴ：Quote

Phase Ⅳ：Trading

Phase Ⅲ：Market Making

Phase Ⅱ：PuC Created

Phase Ⅰ：CoT Created



 

34 
 

1. CoT Created: A contract template is created by the CoT maker, specifying the 

anchored underlying assets, deal structure and quote corporation. The template is 

submitted and will be written into a block. Until then, the template will be invisible. 

2. PuC Created: Based on the template, a trader will create a concrete PuC, which 

defines various key elements of the deal such as the delivery time, deal price, unit, 

deposit percentage, contract price, trading direction, etc. This contract will also specify 

its market maker (it will be the creator of the contract by default).The contract is 

submitted and written into a block. Until then, the contract is invisible. 

3. Market Making: The market maker designated by the PuC pays the liquidity 

deposit and provide market making service for the deals specified in the PuC. The 

market maker needs to refill the deposit account once its balance is too low. The market 

maker can earn profit through the ask-bid spread of market making activities. 

4. Trading: Any user with FOTA on the platform can participate in the trading 

specified by the PuC. To participate, a user needs to pay certain amount of deposit and 

transaction fee. The main difference between the life cycles of PuC and PrC contracts 

lies in the market making and trading phases. The former follows the market maker 

trading mode, in which all users can participate in the trading with market makers; the 

latter uses whole network broadcasting for quoting and inquiry. Once two parties are 

matched during the broadcasting, a 1-to-1 customized contract will be signed between 

them. This difference is illustrated in the figure below: 

 



 

35 
 

5. Quote: Upon the delivery date specified in the PuC contract, the contract will 

utilize the quote corporation specified in its template and inquires the price for the 

corresponding underlying assets. The quote corporation will determine a consensus 

result based on the SVD algorithm and provide it for the contract fulfillment. 

6. Audit: Both parties of the deal needs to confirm and agree on the contract 

fulfillment conditions. If either party refuses the conditions, it can request for an audit 

by all the nodes in the network. In this case, price inquiry will be done by all the nodes 

instead of the QC. Note that, the party who requested the audit will pay a certain amount 

of audit fee. However, if the audit is successful, the audit fee will be covered by the QC. 

7. Clearing: After both parties confirmed the contract fulfillment conditions, they 

will clear the deal by paying off their balances. The deposits will be refunded to them 

after that.  

8. PuC Mature: Upon the clearing, the contract finishes its life cycle. In the 

meantime, Fortuna will keep a record of the behaviors of all relevant entities of this 

contract, which can be used to construct a credit database. 

2.7 DPOSA Consensus Algorithm 

To ensure the security and orderliness of the whole block chain, a block can only 

be generated upon certain consensus. The consensus algorithm is one of the key 

elements of a block chain. In terms of the choice of the consensus algorithms, block 

chains face the same challenge of all distributed systems - the CAP10 principle, i.e., only 

two of the three following properties can be achieved at the same time: Consistency, 

Availability and Partition-Tolerance.  

Correspondingly, all block chains can only excel two of the following three aspects: 

energy efficiency, decentralization and security. The commonly used consensus 

algorithms are POW, POS, DPOS and PBFT. Their performances in terms of these three 

aspects are shown below:   



 

36 
 

 

 POW: Proof of Work, generate a new block through massive hash 

computations which result in an appropriate random number. This is most secure 

mechanism. But it also comes with the highest energy cost. 

 POS: Proof of Stake, reduces the difficulty for block generation according to 

the amount and time of tokens possessed, which also greatly reduces the energy cost of 

POW. However, its security is sacrificed and is susceptible to bifurcation. 

 DPOS: Delegate Proof of Stake. A certain number of delegates are elected by 

voting. These delegates will generate blocks in a certain sequence, which greatly 

reduced the number of verification nodes that are needed. In this mechanism, deal 

verification is greatly accelerated with no sacrifice of security. However, the system 

becomes more centralized. 

 PBFT: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance. No token is required in this 

mechanism, making it suitable for alliance chains. 

After weighing all the pros and cons, Fortuna decides to use an improved hybrid 

DPOS algorithm for consensus determination, establishing a secure and efficiency 

consensus mechanism. Besides increased centralization, DPOS has another obvious 

problem: the voting rights are controlled by users with more FOTA, which marginalized 

the roles of other users with less FOTA. To overcome this issue, Fortuna introduced an 



 

37 
 

active index, to reflect how active a user is on the platform. This purpose of this active 

index is to 1) encourage the active participation of users; 2) balance their financial 

contribution and activeness contribution. The active index is calculated as follows. 

𝑈𝐿 = 𝑇𝐿 + 𝐴𝐿 

𝑇𝐿 = 𝑁𝐶𝑜𝑇 + 𝑁𝑃𝑟𝐶 + 𝑁𝑃𝑢𝐶 + 𝑁𝑀𝑀 

𝐴𝐿 = 𝑁𝑆𝐴 − 𝑁𝐹𝐴 

𝑈𝐿：user activeness； 

𝑇𝐿：trading activeness； 

𝐴𝐿：arbitrage activeness； 

𝑁𝐶𝑜𝑇：number of CoT created，the CoT has to be used for at least one deal； 

𝑁𝑃𝑟𝐶：number of deals cleared under PrC contracts； 

𝑁𝑃𝑢𝐶：number of deals cleared under PuC contracts； 

𝑁𝑀𝑀：number of times serving as a market maker； 

𝑁𝑆𝐴：number of times that the consensus result agrees with the arbitrage result； 

𝑁𝐹𝐴：number of times that the consensus result differs from the arbitrage result. 

The 101 delegates elected according to the DPOSA in each round will reach an 

agreement on the block generation sequence (2 / 3 of the nodes need to reach agreement) 

before the blocks are generated. Unless more than 1 /3 of the delegates collaborate to 

sabotage the system, no bifurcation will occur.  

2.8 FOTA Value Locking Service 

As a distributed risk hedging block chain platform, the purpose of Fortuna is to 

achieve rational risk management through decentralization. However, as the only 

medium used on the Fortuna platform, FOTA is actively traded on the secondary market 

as a digital asset. It will cause devastating damage to the risk hedging trades if its value 

is unstable. Therefore, Fortuna introduces the FOTA Value Locking Service (FVLS) to 



 

38 
 

make sure risk hedging trades can be completed under the stable FOTA value. We use 

the exchange rate between FOTA and RMB as an example to illustrate FVLS. Suppose 

user A and B signed a simple risk hedging contract: each of them pays 100 FOTA as 

deposit. A will earn 100 FOTA if its expectation is right, it will lose 100 FOTA otherwise. 

The trading modes with and without FVLS are as follows. 

 

1. Hedging without FVLS 

In this case, upon the maturity of the contract, if A’s judgement is correct, it will 

earn 100 FOTA. A receives 200 FOTA (profit and deposit). But because FOTA devalued 

50% against RMB, the 200 FOTA still worth the same as the 100 FOTA that was paid 

before the deal. Effectively, user A did not profit nor lose. 

2. Hedging with FVLS 

In this case, the exchange rate between FOTA and RMB will be locked by Fortuna 

until the delivery date of the contract. In the above scenario, when A receives the 200 



 

39 
 

FOTA, Fortuna will offer 200 extra FOTA to user A in order to offset the loss due to 

change of exchange rate between FOTA and RMB. The FLVS makes sure users can 

hedge without being affected by the fluctuation of FOTA value.  

When providing FVLS, Fortuna will execute trades at the opposite position in the 

secondary market to achieve dynamic risk hedging and control the overall risk in the 

platform. A certain amount of fee needs to be paid by the user for this service. 

2.9 Compliance Filter 

For the purpose of compliance and sustainable development, Fortuna will set up a 

compliance filter. Its details are as below: 

1. Types of filter rules: the categories of compliance filters includes ID type (filter 

based on the ID of a certain contract template), asset type (filter by the type of underlying 

assets), deal attribute type (filter by a certain attribute of the deal, for example, the lower 

limit of the deposit fraction), entity type (filter by the entities in the deals, i.e. blocking 

any deal with a certain entity) 

2. Enactment/Invalidation of filter rules: a compliance filter rule needs the 

agreement by the whole network to enact. Certain rules may be invalided under certain 

circumstances, such as setting up error, reopening. 

Upon the enactment of the compliance filter rules: 

1) The rules will be added into the blocks. Before a new template is created, the 

platform will query these rules. If any rule is matched, the contract template cannot be 

created.  

2) After each iteration of the compliance filter rules, the platform will scan all 

existing contract templates. Any template that are not compliant will be removed. 

We think that a comprehensive compliance filter system is the foundation for the 

sustainable development of Fortuna. Therefore, as our business grows, we will update 

this system in a timely manner, keeping the platform thrive on a healthy, lawful and 

compliant track.
