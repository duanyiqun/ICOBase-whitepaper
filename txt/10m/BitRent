Executive summary for BitRent 

BitRent - a platform for decentralized organization of real estate investment based on 
Blockchain and Smart Contracts.  

Our Mission 

Provide everyone with the opportunity to make investments in real estate, both 
commercial and residential, at any construction stage with no geographical reference. 
Our ultimate goal is to make this process as fast, transparent, and secure as possible.  

What Problem Does BitRent Solve? 

One of the most widespread problems of the real estate market of today is a reserved 
and conservative approach during the early stage of construction, when a developer 
needs seed capital most of all. An outdated control and monitoring model in 
construction sector usually causes construction rise in price and a failure to meet the 
date of facility commissioning, thus, making this sector quite unaffordable for the 
majority of people. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of a unified database of 
construction objects in need of additional funds as well as the limited access to this 
information of a general public. BitRent solves these issues by combining the following 
innovative technologies within one platform: BIM, RFID, LEED, BREEAM, Blockchain, 
Primavera and Smart Contracts. The mentioned above solution offers everyone, from 
large companies to individuals, an access to the   opportunity to participate in 
constructions at early stages and with no geographical reference. At the same time, 
this platform provides developers from all over the world with the opportunity to pull 
together funds from multiple unrelated sources, significantly increasing the pull of 
participants. Such a system promotes competition and more adequate pricing. 

How Does BitRent Operate? 

A developer publishes an object on BitRent platform with the aim to draw funds. A 
token holder (or the “Member”) who has an access to this platform chooses the object 
that best meets his/her criteria/interests. Then, Smart Contracts Pool is built as a 
basis for all platform’s elements functioning, including token holder - developer 
cooperation. The Member transfers chosen cryptocurrency or fiat to the construction 
project’s wallet. The Member controls all construction processes in real time.  

The Company and Management 

BitRent is headquartered and incorporated in the City of London. BitRent founder –

BitRent Token (Rntb) 

Soft cap: 	 	     	     3 500 ETH 
Target cap: 	 	   	   60 000 ETH 
Hard cap: 	 	 	 100 000 ETH 
Limited emission: 	 1 000 000 000 Rntb 
Ethereum ERC20 token 

Pre-sale and ICO projections 

In the course of Pre-sale, you have a unique opportunity to get tokens with a 40% 
discount at the primary stage and 25% discount at the final one.  
The price is to be determined during Pre-sale.  
Duration: 78 days.  
Emission: 200,000,000 Rntb tokens. 

The amount of Rntb received for ETH should be counted based on the following 
formula:  

�6



Sum = X・Y/Z  

Sum stands for the amount of Rntb received.  
X stands for the amount of ETH needed to buy Rntb.  
Y stands for the emission of Rntb for a certain period.  
Z stands for the total amount of ETH received in the current period.  

Example: 
A token buyer is willing to purchase the amount of Rntb worth 10 ETH. The emission 
in the current period stands for 200,000,000 Rntb, with 1,000,000 ETH received 
during this period. 

Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/1 000 000 ETH = 2 000 Rntb 
	  

The use of such formula makes it virtually impossible for one token buyer to purchase 
all tokens.  

Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/50 000 ETH = 40 000 Rntb  
Token price 1 Rntb = 0,00025 ETH  

BitRent is a unique blockchain platform that unites crypto-community on the one hand 
and real estate developers, on the other hand and allows every person in the world to 
become a real estate owner in any part of the Earth.

Introduction 

The primary stage of construction is the most beneficial for purchasing commercial 
and residential real estate, but it is not obtainable for everyone. Our aim is to give 
everyone an opportunity to access the most promising industrial, commercial, and 
residential objects at all construction stages and all over the world and to provide 
developers with a chance to access a huge pool of interested parties looking to buy 
real estate at the construction stage. Moreover, an outdated model of construction 
control and monitoring, which is generally performed almost in a manual way, leads to 
a rise of the construction cost price and a failure to meet initial deadlines. BitRent 
platform allows to deal with all such challenges by a symbiosis of open modeling BIM 
technologies, monitoring automation of all building stages, green standards, and a 
possibility of equity participation within the most perspective commercial and 
residential objects at all stages of construction with the help of cryptocurrency. 
Besides, using smart-contracts the platform makes investing in commercial, industrial 
and residential real estate clear and predictable for an ordinary user anywhere in the 
world. The decentralized blockchain system will provide much better control over 
building process and will decrease transaction costs. We believe that BitRent platform 
will change world’s view on blockchain in the area of the real estate. All technologies 
introduced within this platform will ultimately change the status quo in building and 
investing areas.

1. Description of the industry 
1.1. Main tendencies of the industry 

As indicated in this White Paper, the Rntb token provides token holders with an 
access to the worldwide cross-functional trading platforms for real estate construction 
projects at all stages of development. The real estate market has a number of 
potential advantages. First, the real estate market has low-level volatility. Second, 
despite the low-level risk, such assets’ income is quite high. Ownership in commercial, 
industrial and residential real estate allows to get stable income. Third incomparable 
important advantage of the real property is the protection from inflation. It also 
prevents asset and rent price rise at the time of money depreciation. All of the above-
mentioned advantages make real estate purchasing extremely practical for the 
purpose of portfolio diversification and minimization of market risks and 
macroeconomic shocks.  

In the context of permanent world-population growth and rapid economic 
development, commercial real estate market has unlimited opportunities for 
expansion, which means that more and more people will be interested in investing 
their savings in such assets.  

There is a new investing trend emerging in the financial field. More private individuals 
are getting interested in small amount investments within equity construction market, 
with P2P platforms appearing on the horizon. One of the most well-known examples 
is RealtyShares crowdfunding platform, which allows to invest as little as $500. Their 
user base already has 92,000 registered investors.  

35% of investors consider real state to be the best low-risk asset for investments. 
65% 35% Other assets: gold, bonds, state company stocks.

The real property market itself is the key element of the economy and a part of 
national wealth of the country. In 2016, the amount of the world real estate market 
was $217 trillion. What is more, $8.6 trillion from total amount was made through the 
building market. According to Global Construction Perspectives and PWC's 
predictions, by 2020 the amount of the world construction market is about to increase 
almost by 74% - in money terms $15 trillion.  

74% growth of the global market of the real estate construction expected within 5 
years.

74% growth of the global market of the real estate construc-
tion expected within 5 years 

�  
In the new decade, in 2020-2030, construction will be aimed at developing regions. It 
will be explained not only by the rapid population growth, but also by the growth of 
the economic attractiveness of India, China, and South Africa. In 2020, it is expected 
that about 55% of the world construction market will fall on developing countries' 
markets as against 46% in 2016. Due to the economic growth in China, India, and 
Indonesia, the market of the real estate construction is to make 16.5% from GDP 
against 14.9% in 2016. Besides, according to McKinsey Global Institute, it is expected 
that in 15 years a quarter of all population is to be accommodated in 600 largest 
cities' agglomerations, thus, building a new tendency in mass residential building, 
commercial and industrial infrastructure.

Consequently, the real estate market is characterized by positive tendencies in all 
senses.

 The lack of necessary resources will become the new problem for the construction 
market. By 2050 the Earth's population is to reach almost 10 billion people according 
to the UN's predictions. According to the same source, by 2050 there might be 
almost 200 million of eco-refugees all over the world. This is due to the shortage of 
high-quality food, lack of clean water, and polluted air. All these predictions draw us 
closer to the well-known trend of "green" construction.  

Ecological construction does not only bring positive externalities for the society, but 
also improves economic health of a building. It is proved that economic efficiency of 
"green" construction contributes to the increase of building's capitalization by 
7.5-8.2% when ecological standards certificate is collected. One may also observe a 
decrease of operating costs by 8-9%, quantity reduction of vacant areas, growth of 
building's occupancy by 3.5% as well as an opportunity to raise rent from 3% to 8%. 
Everise Consulting experts mark that applying such technologies may lead to reduced 
building terms, infrastructure expenses as well as creation of a lot more attractive and 
modern buildings.

According to the report of CBRE's 2017 National Green Building Adoption Index, 
today almost 40% of areas of the commercial real estate in the 30 largest cities of the 
USA already match green standards. Chinese five-year plan #13, started in 2016, 
requires that at least half of new constructions have to be certificated on ecological 
standards.  

“Green” construction is closely tied to the introduction of new technological decisions 
within building and management of the real estate objects. Such approach requires 
permanent collection and deep analysis of information.

1) RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) 

RFID is a contactless data exchange technology. RFID tags are usually used for the 
inventory and commodities identification with the help of a reader. RFID primary 
advantage is an opportunity to read data within a certain radius, register objects' 
movements, and perform search.  

With the development of digitalization, more demands on RFID technologies will 
appear. According to Grand View Research, RFID market will reach $40.5 billion as 
against only $16,2 billion in 2016. One of the most promising directions for RFID 
systems' development is their use in construction. First of all, RFID tags are placed on 
all objects used during building process.  

Afterwards, these tags are being read in real time, which means that we can track the 
building process online. The primary benefit of such technology is timely notifications 
as well as absence of human factor. In the case of below-proof issues or repairing of 
damaged objects on the construction site, these faults will be traced with up-to-the 
second accuracy, and, at best, fixed immediately upon their appearance.  

Thanks to a powerful combination of blockchain and RFID technologies, tags and 
readers will be effectively protected from any fake alternatives. Such synergy of two 
technologies will allow to get reliable and quick information about the building stages 
as well as object’s state up to its dismantling. Large companies all over the world 
finally understood the importance of the combination of these two important 
technological trends. Thus, IBM Company created a blockchain platform to keep track 
of trucks and their cargo. In addition, such trucks are equipped with RFID systems 
that collect data on distance covered, which is sent straight to blockchain’s memory. 

�12



2) BIM (Building Information Modeling) 

BIM decisions are meant for creating and collecting information about the building 
under construction at any stage of its existence. This technology allows to reproduce 
an accurate, in all parameters, model on computers and other devices.  

The use of BIM facilitates designing processes at all stages, performs analysis and 
control of all construction activities. BIM technology takes into consideration all 
geometrical features of a building and all its structural elements. Such a complete 
model makes it possible to see all potential outcomes during construction in advance, 
assess efficiency rate, compare alternative options in order to focus on the best one 
and make an accurate schedule of all construction stages.  

The combination of BIM, blockchain and RFID technologies, leads to resounding 
accuracy growth of all processes. Blockchain amplifies data stream control and 
protects it from any potential frauds. 

#   

3) Smart-contracts 

Smart-contracts system is, without exaggeration, regarded as the main technology, 
among those mentioned above, and forms a basis of the whole project. Smart-
contracts system, built on blockchain technology, allows storing of reliable information 
on all construction stages and deals made. Smart-contracts withdraw the trust issue 
from the agenda between contracting officers and not only significantly speed up the 
process, but also make it more transparent. Smart-contracts also simplify the 

�13



transacting process within real estate deals. These very smart contracts will form a 
basis for registers of construction object ownership. Unlike traditional methods, these 
documents are much safer. This cutting-edge technology guarantees safe money 
transactions making them simpler and quicker. 

1.2. Main problems of the industry


In spite of positive trends in the field of real estate and construction, this sector faces a 
range of problems.  

Problem: influence of geo-
graphic factor.

Solut ion: opportunity to 
purchase real estate anywhere in the 
world from any location on the Earth 
without being bound to a particular 
country.

According to the statistics, 87% of real 
estate buyers currently purchase real 
estate items located in their place of 
residence. This is due to the physical 
ability to supervise the construction 
process and better understanding of local 
engineering standards. It also simplifies 
the resale process due to familiarity with 
local market.

BitRent platform enables members to 
purchase any real estate item remotely. All 
transactions are processed instantly. 
Moreover, thanks to smart contract 
register, your purchase and real estate 
ownership are properly recorded and 
effectively protected. You don’t need to 
stand in lines to appropriate authorities 
and go through a complicated process of 
gathering multiple documents in order to 
obtain a proof of ownership for immovable 
property. 

Problem: high entry barrier to 
participate in purchasing real estate.

Solution: opportunity to buy in 
portions using cryptocurrency.

Buying whole real estate objects require 
possession of quite substantial capital 
sums equal to the cost of the target real 
estate (starting from $20,000 - 30,000 
and higher), and lack of option to 
purchase real estate objects in portions. 

BitRent platform provides an opportunity 
to every individual and company to 
participate in eco real estate construction. 
The real estate sector becomes more 
technological, with meeting eco standards 
never to result in objects price rise due to 
efficient blockchain management, smart 
p r o c u r e m e n t p o l i c y a s w e l l a s 
subcontractors choice and etc. 

�

Problem: non-transparency of 
the construction process and 
financial losses when it comes to a 
“freeze” of project construction.

Solution: combining BIM and 
Primavera with Blockchain and 
Smart Contracts. 

The dynamics of modern life makes all 
processes go faster, including both 
cons t ruc t iona l and a rch i tec tu ra l . 
Therefore, even a very slight construction 
“freeze” turns into heavy losses of assets, 
which, could go towards improvement of 
aesthetical or functional qualities of 
immovable property. The longer project is 
considered to be “frozen”, the more vague 
becomes the finishing date of a project as 
well as the final costs of the construction. 
One of the standard causes of unplanned 
“freezes” is non-transparency of the 
construction process and a great number 
o f unnecessary agreements w i th 
subcontracting parties.

Problem: lack of widespread 
application of “green” technologies 
in real estate construction.

Solution: building objects using 
LEED and BREEAM certificates and 
monitoring tags. 

Currently, developers are not ready to 
spend money on genuine eco-
construction due to increased expenses 
and project delivery time. BitRent builds a 
distributed ledger using RFID, Smart 
Contract, LEED and BREEAM 
technologies. Such approach will cause 
eco-construction to be more developer 
attractive. An object built in compliance 
with “green” standards automatically rises 
in price by 25-30%, when on sale.

1.3. Competitors 

Efforts have been made to address the mentioned above challenges with a help of 
traditional projects as well as projects based on blockchain technologies, but none of 
them have been successful so far. BitRent is the first ever project that resolves legal, 
financial, and technical issues alltogether. Nevertheless, for the sake of our members, 
we would like to introduce a comparison study of the big league technological real 
estate market players possessing products based on traditional as well as blockchain 
technologies.  

Thus, BitRent is the first blockchain project, which includes a global proprietary rights 
register, a platform allowing to find, access, participate in, and control real estate 
projects, and pull together funds necessary to start or continue any construction 
project in the shortest timespan anywhere in the world. Furthermore, such 
construction will be the most transparent process ever because token purchasers can 
check all legal, technological, and financial documentation provided by developer, 
stored on blockchain, and available online. Besides that, this is the first project that 
implements global eco standards in the field of real estate construction without raising 
building costs.

2. About BitRent project 
2.1. Brief description of  BitRent project 

BitRent project is a cross-functional purchase/monitoring/sale platforms for real estate 
construction projects at all stages of development worldwide. Below is a detailed 
description of each and every functional part. 

2.1.1. Construction monitoring and comfort control of BitRent structures 

As a rule, managing companies spend a lot of time to manually monitor all stages of 
construction from the design to assessment of effectiveness and comfort level, which 
negatively affects the cost and facility completion deadline.  

Bitrent is the first decentralized platform that allows members to track in a real time 
online mode all the processes of the construction from the modeling to the final 
inspection of the finished building with the help of smart-contracts and blockchain. 
Such a register is maintained through assigning to each operational process a unique 
number kept in the architecture of smart-contracts (smart-contracts about modeling, 
all stages of construction, the shared participation in investment etc.)  

� 


�17



2.1.2. BitRent trading platform 

BitRent is a platform for decentralized organization of real estate purchases based on 
blockchain and smart contracts. BitRent is the first platform to provide access to the 
worldwide database of industrial, commercial and residential real estate at all stages of 
construction to all interested individuals and companies. It also allows to make secure 
transactions and monitor statuses of various projects. 

#  

2.2. BitRent Goals 

2.2.1. Construction control optimization  

Aiming to optimize control over construction projects and to improve their efficiency, 
blockchain-based BitRent platform developed a wide range of technologies that make 
purchase of real estate at the initial stage of construction simple, transparent, and 
available to   anyone. This platform provides Rntb holders with an opportunity to 
purchase real estate worldwide at the most beneficial stage of primary construction 
with almost no expenses at all. Plus, they gain total online control over construction 
process.  

�18



Thus, BitRent will transform the primary commercial and residential real estate market, 
making it more affordable, transparent, safer, more reliable, flexible, and dynamic as 
there will be no more need to hire audit companies that are inevitably involved in 
construction process. 

2.2.2. Affordability 

BitRent's platform eliminates any minimum requirements for participating in any real 
estate project. BitRent's platform provides safe and efficient participation in 
construction since all real estate operations are kept within smart-contracts 
environment. Thus, BitRent represents a combination of legal, financial, technical, and 
blockchain components meant to dramatically change the field of the real estate 
market! 

2.2.3. Implementing eco standards in construction  

We believe that climate change and shortage of resources will reinforce eco 
standards’ standing in construction. Nevertheless, we also believe that, with 
competent management of construction funds, these standards will not lead to an 
automatic price increase.  

All constructions participating in BitRent platform will be equipped with trackers 
transmitting data as shown on the figure below. The process will meet all Comfort 
Energy Ecology standards based upon 9 key parameters (light version of LEED, 
BREEAM, DGNB). BitRent platform will collect such data and pass it over to platform’s 
members upon completion of the construction process.  

This means that a client will be empowered to choose the most practical option in 
terms of the comfort level, energy efficiency rate, and building conditions, will reduce 
negative environmental impact, and will have better expense policy. Certain trackers 
will be stored in buildings for about 50 years, which will help to control their condition 
down to its dismantling or recycling.

By adopting ecological standards, BitRent platform will also stimulate developers, 
willing to be listed by BitRent, to focus on implementation of eco standards in their 
construction projects. In doing so, BitRent platform will support self-sufficient circular 
economy when all resources are recycled. We believe that eco standards will become 
an integral part of the world real estate market!

2.3. Technical solutions used in BitRent 

2.3.1. General technical description of BitRent 

BitRent uses the following technology: 

#  
In years to come, BitRent aims at using distributed databases in order to store lists in 
the form of transitional steps on the way toward decentralized solution. Mobile and 
desktop applications will have digital wallets to keep BitRent tokens (Rntb), so that 
token holders may keep their Rntbs that are collected as rewards, which are 
described further.  

2.3.2. Smart contract architecture 

The architecture of smart contracts consists of several elements: 

#

Server 

C# .NET Web API Service, 
MongoDB database. 

Two replica sets, Oauth identity 
check, all services 

used across Microsoft Azure.

iOS application client 

ObjectiveC 
(supports all smartphones). 

Compatibility: iOS8 and higher 
BitRent buy-rent-properties.

Website

2.3.3. P2P platform operation algorithm   

The working process of exchange platform and collaborative use can be described as 
follows: 

1. Sellers display property description on BitRent platform. 
2. Buyers search for real state that matches their criteria. 
3. Buyers send offers using smart contracts to register subjects under 

corresponding legal conditions. 
4. Sellers accept offers by e-signatures. 
5. Intermediaries fulfill their functions (agreement analysis, notarial procedures and 

etc.). 
6. When all the mentioned above conditions are met, smart contracts launch 

payment system that enables buyers to deliver payments in digital money. 
7. Smart contracts monitor payments and transfer property to a new owner in 

BitRent register upon fulfillment of all conditions. 

We design this system in modular way and enable buyers to monitor fulfillment of the 
contract terms. 
 

2.4. Legal framework for BitRent's activity 

BitRent project is to be delivered by establishment of non-public companies in 
accordance with the UK law. Legal organizational form is to be determined on 
lawyers’ recommendations in compliance with safe and legally secure model of 
dealing with digital money and its investors with ICO under preparation.  

Public relationships between a company and members (or “ICO participants”) will be 
governed by partnership liabilities (public offer) within the frame of funds’ tokens 
produced. Tokens, however, do not grant the right to run a company since they do 
not function as equity shares.

�22



3. BitRent Business Model 

3.1. BitRent Strategy 

We aim to launch an entirely decentralized platform for attracting buyers into 
construction sector based on blockchain technology. As for facilities to be offered for 
sale, these are constructions selected by BitRent, that comply with eco standards and 
equipped with BitRent trackers. This will provide token holders with exhaustive 
information on the status of any real estate item within the decentralized network.

3.3. Financial argumentation of BitRent project 

The platform will be launched under any condition, that is, the platform will be 
established even if the required amount of funds is not collected. 

Collecting 100% of the planned amount: 

Collecting 50% or less of the planned amount: 

The platform will be launched in any case, that is, it will be established even if 
the required amount of funds is not collected.  

The financial background of BitRent project is based upon analytical research of key 
industry indicators as well as competitive ecosystems. Aggregated data on market 
structure and its dynamics, including projected market share of the project and its 
growth rates, has been used to provide more accurate assessment. The expected 
world market volume of construction in 2018 will be $11,4 trillion.  

We believe that, if marketing budgets are used properly, we may expect every 
thousandth transaction to be made on our platform, which would give us 0,1% of 
market share. Based on this prognosis and the average level of commission fees 
between 1,5-3,5% from transactions amounts, we plan to expect an average annual 
revenue of $ 171 million in 2018.

3.3.1. BitRent's offered product 

BitRent project is of interest for all real estate and construction market players, 
including private individuals and companies. As mentioned above, BitRent is an 
innovative platform meant to provide every interested person or entity with a real-time 
access to a worldwide base of real estate projects and to enable secure and fast real 
estate transactions using cryptocurrency with a help of construction monitoring 
system.  
BitRent's income consists of charging interests from real estate turnover transactions.  

3.3.2. BitRent's planned sales 

As previously noted, BitRent platform charges small interests upon successful 
completion of transactions in digital currency as well as for usage of premium services 
(with the interest rate averaging between 1,5% and 3,5% depending on the type of 
transaction). All payments are made using digital currency (in countries where it is 
officially permitted) and/or fiat money (in countries where digital currency transactions 
are forbidden).  

Given the fact that the foreign purchases/sales real estate market is rated $11,4 
trillion, with BitRent project’s target markets covering almost all mature and developing 
economies, we may strive to get the project’s turnover to amount to $11,4 billions, 
provided its marketing strategy is carried out in a smart way. Interest, as well as 
premium service payments, charged by BitRent, are well below those of the 
competitors, which makes this product quite competitive and promising through the 
lens of economics.

4. Token Rntb  

4.1. Token Structure 

1. Rntb is a utility token for the following purposes:  

 •	 It does not provide any equity interest in BitRent company; 
	 •	 Its main function to provide an access to the BitRent base and transaction 

system; 
	 •	 Funds collected will not be distributed until the platform is ready for launching; 
	 •	 All collected funds will be kept in escrow; 
	 •	 Token holders will have the right to select real estate projects to participate in, 

to monitor their progress, and to stop their participation, i.e. they do not rely 
exclusively on the actions of others; 

	 •	 In addition to access rights, the Rntb token represents a method of payment for 
services and processing fees of the platform, including advertisement 
campaigns and project promotion on the platform; 

	 •	 Priority access rights based on the number of tokens purchased by the holder 
(currently, for buyers of 1000 tokens or more, but the platform reserves the right 
to change the specified quantity); 

	 •	 Tokens can be driven out of the platform and sold on the exchange. 

2. Prices for all services and processing fees are set in fiat, but to be paid in tokens. 
When a payment is performed, the system determines the amount of tokens, 
based on the going exchange rate, then takes them from a client’s wallet or buys 
the necessary quantity according to the going rate on the exchange via integrated 
exchange module.  

3. Commission collected by the platform falls into two groups: 

	 • 50% of tokens are reserved on the platform during services delivery;  
	 • 50% of tokens are burned (the platform reserves the right to change the 
specified percentage ratio) . 

4. For the project to be placed on the platform, it has to first go through the 
platform’s audit procedure; audit processing time varies in accordance with the 
chosen service packages. 

5. To take part in voting on the platform, all users should have no less than 1000 
tokens on their accounts (the platform reserves the right to change the specified 
quantity).  

6. To get access to project information, token purchasers choose a range of services 
via subscription based approach. These services differ by sets of information from 
basic data to live stream from tags and cameras on site.  

�28



7. To promote projects, developers are provided with the service that can give their 
projects higher position in search results. 

8. In the form of additional services, the platform offers legal support/control for deals 
with an object placed on the platform. 

9. The platform renders Escrow services for projects and makes sure that the 
projects use funds as indicated in the Roadmap. 

  

4.2. Rules of vote and statement of construction objects  

1. The user has to have on the account 1000 Rntb (the platform reserves the right to 
change the specified quantity). 

2. The developer undergoes preliminary registration to add the offered object to the 
voting list. 

3. Users get access to the voting list. 

4. The voting list has a number of parameters to filter objects by specific criteria: type 
of an object, its location, construction costs, rating of the developer, and other 
factors. 

5. To be listed, each object has to receive a specific number of votes. The required 
minimum may vary depending on the project’s costs, country of placement, 
developer’s rating and other factors. For example, a project with higher costs and 
lower rating of the country will require a higher number of votes. Please see “The 
table for determination of minimum number of votes below.” Example: Developer 
wishes to begin construction on the territory of the USA requiring a budget of $2 
million. According to this Table, it will require at least  400 voices (300 votes due to 
the budget required + 100 votes due to the country of placement.) BitRent 
reserves the right to change this Table. 

The table for determination of necessary number of votes

$1 million - $10 million 300 Asia 200

$10 million - $100 million 500 Africa 500

from $100 million 700 Europe 100

�29



6. Once the necessary number of votes is reached, a confirmation of passing 
verification and final addition is sent to the developer.  

7. Users voted for the passing developer receive privileges. Examples of such 
privileges include a free set of digital copies of all project documents, a free 6-
month subscription to premium projects, and other preferences. 

8. After each voting, 1000 Rntb (the platform reserves the right to change the 
specified quantity) is written off the voting user’s balance. In exchange, except for 
the cases of bonus access described in item 7, the voting user receives points 
and increases his rating. To receive 1 point, the user must vote for 3 objects (the 
platform reserves the right to change this option).

5. ICO Conditions 

5.1. Issuing BitRent token 

The Rntb tokens have a fixed total amount of 1 billion tokens. Therefore, as demand 
will grow, there will be no increase in the total number of tokens. The number of 
tokens that may be issued at each stage is indicated below.

The limited number of Rntb tokens that may be issued should protect the token from

5.3. Cost estimation of BitRent token  

First stage of the token sale will last until December 1, 2017. During this stage, 200 
million token Rntb (20% of the total emission) will be offered for sale. The second 
stage starts on December 1, 2017, offering 699 million tokens for sale (69,9% of total 
issuing). Remaining 100 million tokens (10% of the total issue) are reserved for BitRent 
and will not be available for exchange trading. Token purchaser may use ETH or BTC 
only to buy the Rntb tokens, with the price going unfixed and varied depending on the 
market.  

The amount of Rntb received for ETH should be counted based on the following 
formula: 

 Sum = X・Y/Z  

Sum stands for the amount of Rntb received.  
X stands for the amount of ETH needed to buy Rntb.  
Y stands for the emission of Rntb for a certain period.  
Z stands for the total amount of ETH received in the current period.  

Example  
Token purchaser is willing to buy the Rntb worth of 10 ETH. The emission in the 
current period stands for 200,000,000 Rntb, with 1,000,000 ETH received during this 
period. 	  

Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/1 000 000 ETH = 2 000 Rntb 	 	  

The use of such formula makes it virtually impossible for one purchaser to buy all 
tokens.  

Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/50 000 ETH = 40 000 Rntb  
Token price 1 Rntb = 0,00025 ETH  

The minimum purchase volume of 1 token is 0,01 Ethereum.

The risk factors 

The purchase of tokens is associated with a high risk degree, including, but not limited 
to the risks listed below. Before purchasing Rntb tokens, each potential buyer is 
recommended to carefully pay attention to all the information and risks outlined in this 
White Paper, BitRent’s Purchase Agreement, and, particularly to the following factors:  

1. Computer infrastructure dependence: dependence of Bitrent company on the 
functioning of software applications, computer equipment, and the Internet means 
that the Bitrent cannot guarantee that a break of the system will not adversely 
affect the use of Rntb tokens owned by holders. Despite the fact that Bitrent uses 
all reasonable measures to ensure network security, the servers of its data center 
to computer viruses, physical and electronic hacking and other intrusions of a 
similar character. Computer viruses, break-ins and other violations caused by 
actions of third parties can lead to interruptions, delays and suspension of the 
provision of services, which may limit the possibility of using Rntb tokens.  

2. Limitations of the smart contract: the technology of a smart contract is still in its 
early stages of development and its application is of an experimental nature. This 
fact may threaten significant operational, legal, technological, reputational and 
financial risks. Although an audit conducted by an independent third party 
enhances security, accuracy and reliability of a smart contract, it can not serve as 
the warranty, including any expressed warranty that the Rntb smart contract is 
suitable for its intended use, or that it does not contain flaws, weaknesses or other 
problems that may cause technical difficulties or complete loss of the Rntb token. 

3. Legal regulations: Technology of the blockchain, including but not limited to the 
release of tokens, may be a new concept in some jurisdictions that can apply to 
current laws, or enact new legislative regulations based on blocking technology, 
and such regulations may conflict with the current Rntb smart contract and the 
concept of Rntb token.  

4. Taxes: Rntb token holders may have obligations to pay taxes in relation with 
transactions considered herein, in the United States or in their countries of 
residence. In this case, holders of Rntb tokens are solely responsible for 
compliance with US and other jurisdictions and all relevant taxes. 

5. Force Majeure: The activities of the company Bitrent can be interrupted, 
suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of 
this White Paper, force majeure means events and circumstances of an 
extraordinary nature that could not be foreseen by Bitrent, and include natural 
disasters, wars, armed conflicts, riots, industrial conflicts, epidemics, mass layoffs, 
strikes with reduced productivity labor, long-term shortages or interruptions in 
electricity supply or telecommunications services, the actions of the municipal 43 

�44



government, state and federal government, and other circumstances not beyond 
the control of Bitrent, which were not observed at the time of publication of this 
White Paper. If such circumstances occur before the release of Rntb tokens, and 
Bitrent can not issue Rntb tokens within 1 month from the scheduled date, the 
escrow agent may return the money paid to them by Rntb token purchase. The 
refund is paid in the original amount and form of payment to the same digital 
wallet or bank account where the funds were transferred from. 

6. Information disclosure: Personal information received from holders of Rntb tokens, 
information on the number of tokens belonging to holders of Rntb tokens, 
addresses of used purses and other relevant information may be disclosed to law 
enforcement and state authorities and other third parties if Bitrent is required to 
disclose such information by law, subpoena or court order. Bitrent shall in no time 
be responsible for the disclosure of such information for the stated reasons. 

7. Token value: The cost of purchased Rntb tokens can vary significantly for various 
reasons. Bitrent does not guarantee any specific price of Rntb tokens at any 
specific time. Bitrent assumes no responsibility for any changes in the cost of Rntb 
tokens. 

8. Bitcoin and Ether fluctuations: Fluctuations in the bitcoin and Ether exchange rate 
may affect the ability of the company to provide services at specified prices. 
Assumptions in with respect to the above include judgments about future 
economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of 
which are not subject to control by the Bitrent team and, therefore, are difficult to 
accurately predict. Although the Bitrent team believes its assumptions are 
reasonable, any of them may in the future prove to be incorrect. Therefore, the 
Bitrent team does not guarantee that the foreseen preliminary statements given in 
this White Paper will be accurate. In the light of the considerable uncertainty, 
inherent in the forward-looking preliminary statements provided in this document, 
the inclusion of such information can not be interpreted as a guarantee from the 
part of Bitrent or any other legal entity that the objectives and plans of the Bitrent 
project will be successfully implemented.  

A more detailed list of risk factors is set forth in the Risk Matrix document. Please, 
take into consideration that the Bitrent project may be subject to other risks that the 
project team can not foresee at the moment. 

Note: We emphasize that Bitrent team cannot guarantee a steady growth of the price 
of Rntb tokens, and is not responsible for the possible losses with speculative use of 
tokens. Access to that Bitrent services is unconditionally guaranteed on the current 
market price of the Rntb token.
