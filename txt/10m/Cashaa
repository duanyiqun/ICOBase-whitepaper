1.​ ​Executive​ ​Summary  
 

The global financial crisis revealed significant weaknesses in the existing financial system and some of the                

vulnerabilities already showed their impact on the interconnected global market. The world economy is              

still struggling with slow growth rate today . Transferring money for remittance, money lending across              1

international borders is still very complicated, time consuming and expensive . Existing systems running             2 3

on traditional banking channels are slow and full of intermediaries, higher exchange rates, counter-party              

risks,​ ​bureaucracy​ ​and​ ​extensive​ ​paperwork .  4

More than 3.5 billion people are still unbanked or underbanked and have few opportunities to have a                 5 6

safe and secure way to participate in the global economy. On-boarding this missing population to the                

benefits of the global financial system is key in order to provide a sustainable solution for their future                  

economic outlook. However, it turns out that consumers and businesses are struggling to leverage the               

benefits of the Blockchain infrastructure due to poor usability, non customer centric approach and              

improper​ ​legal​ ​implementation. 

Cashaa built its infrastructure on the blockchain and utilizes ​artificial intelligence to power mainstream              
adoption for financial products. It ​empowers the banked and unbanked population, facilitates low cost              
currency exchanges, enables participation in the global economy and develops the new outlook for this               

community by using open architecture​. Instead of rebuilding or riding on the rails of archaic banking                
infrastructure, we built Cashaa to allow consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies, which let people move              

money as they wish at low cost and high speed, without having to understand the technical details of                  

crypto​ ​and​ ​blockchain​ ​technology,​ ​thereby​ ​making​ ​it​ ​user​ ​friendly,​ ​secure,​ ​and​ ​affordable. 

This whitepaper fills the gap between the existing financial system and emerging non-user friendly              

technologies by presenting a secure and simple way to use payments and banking architecture that aims                

to lower financial inclusion barriers and provide financial services to the banked and unbanked. We               

present the advantages of the Cashaa system, outlining its requirements and goals, along with the               

architecture for its financial ecosystem. In addition, we present the results of ​Cashaa’s use case for a                 
remittance​ ​and​ ​trading​ ​system​ ​that​ ​involved​ ​over​ ​12,770​ ​registered​ ​users​ ​from​ ​141​ ​countries.

2.​ ​The​ ​Cashaa:​​ ​​The​ ​next​ ​generation​ ​banking​ ​platform​ ​for​ ​the​ ​next​ ​billion 

The Cashaa team is building a next generation model for financial services which is based on blockchain                 
technology and artificial intelligence which will empower devices with biometric identification systems to             

solve​ ​the​ ​problems​ ​of​ ​the​ ​existing​ ​financial​ ​system​ ​for​ ​the​ ​unbanked​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​banked​ ​population . 7

 

Problem​ ​1: 

Having a traditional rail infrastructure, where moving money requires huge processing efforts includes             
endless problems. One of the main reasons for friction in this current system is that information is siloed                  

between the players in the industry. A meagre amount of engineering is done on the payment systems                 

which are compatible across payment networks and financial institutions. Examples include FedWire ,            8

CHIPS , SWIFT , consumer card payment networks, NSCC/DTCC , OCC , ACH and many others            9 10 11 12 13

depending​ ​on​ ​countries . 14

 

Problem​ ​2: 

The recent emergence of cryptocurrency tokens showed a silver lining to save us from the legacy systems.                 
However, it turns out that a growing number of users and businesses are struggling to leverage on the                  

existing blockchain infrastructure. The primary role of blockchains was to solve coordination and             

synchronization problems amongst multilateral agreements between a network of participants, but it            

seems that these multiple blockchains are now giving a hard time to “real users” and have become a                  

bottleneck for the mainstream adoption . Also the current attempts by others to provide blockchain              15

based solutions lack the workflow needs of small and medium sized enterprises, and the applications are                

not​ ​addressing​ ​the​ ​average​ ​consumer's​ ​issues​ ​and​ ​not​ ​providing​ ​legally​ ​compliant​ ​solutions​ ​to​ ​their​ ​users. 

 

Vision: 

We believe there should be an efficient alternative to existing payment and banking systems. Our               
blockchain-based payments system aims to lower financial inclusion barriers and provide financial services             

to the banked and unbanked. Our vision is to build the payments and banking infrastructure for the future

on a robust AI driven blockchain infrastructure which can make the legacy system obsolete, thus creating                

value​ ​for​ ​the​ ​world.​ ​​ ​Cashaa​ ​is​ ​based​ ​on​ ​4​ ​foundational​ ​principles: 

1. Powering financial products for the Banked and Unbanked​: Cashaa's digital and transparent            
services are not only attractive for the banked population, but they can also deliver financial inclusion                

solutions to the 2.5 billion unbanked and 1 billion underbanked globally, thereby creating a unique               

cross-border​ ​platform​ ​which​ ​can​ ​serve​ ​the​ ​entire​ ​population. 
2. Facilitating low-cost Currency Exchanges​: Send money across borders quickly, for a small flat fee -               
a fraction of the current costs, which today on average are 7 % . Our industry-leading technology platform                 16

powered by our traders network can protect your money and offer best foreign exchange (FX) rates                17

every​ ​time​ ​you​ ​utilize​ ​Cashaa. 
3. Enabling Investments in the Global Economy: ​Cashaa products can enable its users to access the               
global economy in a decentralised manner. They can facilitate the transfer of value across borders allowing                

greater​ ​portfolio​ ​diversification​ ​with​ ​higher​ ​yields . 18

4. Dedicated to the Community with an Open API: ​Create the next generation DApp to solve the                
world's biggest financial challenges. Our developer SDK and Open API with integrated biometric and              

artificial​ ​intelligence​ ​services​ ​will​ ​accelerate​ ​the​ ​growth​ ​of​ ​digital​ ​innovation.

3.​ ​Cashaa​ ​Beta​ ​Launch:​ ​Remittance​ ​&​ ​Trading  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We already built and beta tested a blockchain-powered platform, which offers innovative trading and              
money transfer services between fiat and crypto currencies. ​12,770 beta users across 141 countries tested               
the​ ​platform​ ​transacting​ ​ ​ ​2108.23486​ ​(approx.​ ​$10​ ​M)​.  

Cashaa video (The video gives an overview of cash transfer; over time, Cashaa can process payments in                 
many​ ​other​ ​forms​ ​and​ ​does​ ​not​ ​require​ ​manual​ ​intervention​ ​or​ ​in-person​ ​settlement.) 

During the trading & remittance process, the Bitcoin seller and buyer are asked to deposit their Bitcoins in                  

the escrow. The seller has to deposit 100% of the coins which they have to sell, while the buyer has to put                      

10% collateral which is released as soon as the process completes. The Bitcoin escrow address used in this                  

test​ ​transacting​ ​​ ​ ​​2108.23486​ ​is​ ​mentioned​ ​below:

https://blockchain.info/address/16Z9HPAMriVDmFCqnYzXnLWVfhyxcoW8Qj​​ ​(Secondary​ ​Wallet) 

Major countries where we saw the biggest adoption of our beta test include ​UK, Nigeria, India, Indonesia                 
and Philippines​. During this beta test, we were able to test our ​Remittance and Trading product which                 
created a win-win situation for both the cryptocurrency traders community and the money senders              

community.  

Compared to any other existing trading platforms, our peer to peer exchange with liquidity providing               

mechanism from the remittance industry, clearinghouse messaging network and escrow system resulted            

in increasing market size, higher profit margins, and better speculation opportunities for the traders with               

lower security risks. We found that between and within countries, entrepreneurs could bring the              

advantages of cryptocurrency to their community by using our open API to build global and local payment

solutions. We also validated the opportunity for money transfer shops to switch their payment service               

providers from traditional MTOs to Cashaa. Agents can become less expensive than their competitors, and               

gain a good market share while benefiting from Cashaa’s cost-saving efficiencies. Additionally, Cashaa             

validated during the beta test the relevance of providing 24/7 availability, a rating system, a tool to import                  

reputations​ ​from​ ​other​ ​platforms,​ ​while​ ​introducing​ ​the​ ​security​ ​advantages​ ​of​ ​a​ ​P2P​ ​exchange.  

 

Key​ ​Benefits​ ​of​ ​​ ​Beta​ ​Test: 

● The Cashaa platform (the “​Platform​”) went through several iterations to be robust, and is now               
capable​ ​of​ ​handling​ ​large​ ​transaction​ ​volumes.  
● The Platform is upgraded with strong KYC, AML policies and compliance to make it fully compliant                
with​ ​regulations. 
● Advanced escrow features increase the protection of stakeholders from any manipulation, thus            
mitigating​ ​counterparty​ ​risk​ ​so​ ​that​ ​customers​ ​can​ ​use​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​with​ ​confidence.  
● Operational processes are enhanced to optimise our user experience by involving our community             
in​ ​the​ ​bug​ ​bounty​ ​program​ ​through​ ​our​ ​social​ ​media​ ​and​ ​helpdesk.

4.​ ​Design​ ​Approach 
 

From the architectural point of view, to implement the concept, the Cashaa system is divided into five                 

main component layers that help the platform to scale, maintain and add new features while maintaining                

the highest level of security in a decentralized environment for the blockchain features. We also recognize                

that blockchain technology enables business collaborations that require high reliability and shared, trusted             

privacy​ ​to​ ​preserve​ ​immutable​ ​data​ ​repositories​ ​for​ ​smart​ ​contracts.  

In order to take technical advantages and speedy time to market, Cashaa has teamed up with various                 

organisations to leverage their pre-existing work such as Agrello Foundation for its AI based self aware                19

contract capabilities, Auxledger for its robust infrastructure which has already onboarded 53 million             20

identities and other enterprise infrastructures that would help to scale faster with the built-in capabilities               

of disrupting businesses and impacting millions of people across the globe. Coinfirm which provides data               

that​ ​puts​ ​entities​ ​on​ ​the​ ​safe​ ​side​ ​in​ ​terms​ ​of​ ​regulatory​ ​and​ ​fraud​ ​risk​ ​related​ ​with​ ​cryptocurrencies​ ​​. 

Our design approach is focused around reflecting our vision of customer centricity and user friendly               

applications​ ​while​ ​utilising​ ​the​ ​capabilities​ ​and​ ​promises​ ​of​ ​blockchain​ ​technology.  

As​ ​cyber​ ​security​ ​is​ ​crucial​ ​for​ ​a​ ​fully​ ​digital​ ​service​ ​and​ ​to​ ​protect​ ​our​ ​systems,​ ​Cashaa​ ​has​ ​built​ ​systemic 
solutions​ ​using​ ​the​ ​most​ ​advanced​ ​statistical​ ​and​ ​deep​ ​learning​ ​techniques​ ​to​ ​detect​ ​and​ ​prevent​ ​threats 
in​ ​real-time.​ ​The​ ​integrated​ ​defense​ ​models​ ​have​ ​been​ ​successfully​ ​applied​ ​across​ ​multiple​ ​cyber​ ​sources 
and​ ​will​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​provide​ ​intelligent​ ​protection​ ​for​ ​the​ ​company’s​ ​critical​ ​business​ ​information.

4.1​ ​Ecosystem 

 

1. ​CASConnec​t layer is the first step for each participant to pass. Here, basic KYC checks are done by                   
verifying their email ID and mobile number. For higher transaction slabs, users have to pass stringent                

checks and have to follow a tiered KYC structure that involves OFAC, AML and other guidelines that vary                  

from country to country. This layer will also interact with banks and govt initiatives to use the existing KYC                   

in place. We also provide the option of biometric verification to include undocumented parts of the                

population. 

2. ​CASNet layer enables a blockchain-driven self-aware contract assisted by an agent for a decentralized               
peer-to-peer (P2P) economy. It will have the matching engine and system to define fee %, margins and                 

Copyright​ ​2017​ ​@​ ​Cashaa​ ​Limited 
 



 

bonus. This layer will be using some of the high quality tech work done by our Smart Contract Advisor ​Alex                    
Norta ​ ​and​ ​utilising​ ​the​ ​existing​ ​results​ ​achieved​ ​by​ ​​Qtum​​ ​and​ ​​Agrello​ ​Foundation. 21

3. ​CASFabric is the middle layer with core components for decentralized exchange with clearinghouse              
messaging network, fraud prevention, clock synchronization among the participants and liquidity provider            

mechanism. This layer has the required admin tools allowing admin users to add new cryptocurrencies,               

markets, fiat and create a trader partner contract within minutes to scale solutions, based on the industry                 

adoption and maturity. The developer SDK in C#, JAVA, Python and Go will be published to develop and                  

integrate​ ​it​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Cashaa​ ​platform.​ ​Currently,​ ​Cashaa​ ​has​ ​set​ ​up​ ​exchange​ ​and​ ​FX​ ​pairs​ ​APIs​ ​in​ ​​JSON. 

4. Our ​CASChain layer makes the network interoperable and cryptocurrency neutral, which may             
eventually operate through any digital currency or token which traders prefer, namely, Bitcoin, Ether,              

Ripple, NEO or any ERC-20 compliant token. Blockchain nodes of aforementioned cryptocurrencies will be              

enabled and integrated within CASConnect, thereby making Cashaa a partner of choice for interoperability              

to​ ​grow​ ​alongside​ ​with​ ​the​ ​needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​financial​ ​services​ ​industry.  

5.​ ​​ ​​CASFiat​​ ​layer​ ​will​ ​be​ ​integrated​ ​with​ ​the​ ​banking​ ​system​ ​incorporating​ ​cash​ ​instruments​ ​in​ ​multiple 
currencies​ ​within​ ​the​ ​network.​ ​This​ ​layer​ ​is​ ​responsible​ ​to​ ​decide​ ​the​ ​FX​ ​conversion;​ ​ensures​ ​the 
availability​ ​of​ ​each​ ​FX​ ​value​ ​available​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​and​ ​also​ ​assists​ ​in​ ​working​ ​with​ ​3rd​ ​party​ ​APIs​ ​such 
as​ ​XE,​ ​Reuters​ ​easing​ ​communication​ ​with​ ​payment​ ​networks​ ​across​ ​the​ ​globe. 

 

4.2​ ​​ ​Blockchain​ ​Technology  
 

Cashaa​ ​token​ ​is​ ​implemented​ ​using​ ​Ethereum​ ​EIP-20​ ​(former​ ​ERC-20)​ ​standard.​ ​ ​ ​The​ ​token​ ​is​ ​accepted 22

and​ ​traded​ ​in​ ​Cashaa’s​ ​own​ ​services,​ ​but​ ​is​ ​also​ ​compatible​ ​across​ ​different​ ​Ethereum​ ​wallets​ ​and 
exchanges. 

Cashaa’s​ ​blockchain​ ​technology​ ​stack​ ​is​ ​not​ ​limited​ ​to​ ​Bitcoin​ ​and​ ​Ethereum.​ ​When​ ​applicable,​ ​Cashaa​ ​uses 
different​ ​blockchain​ ​technologies​ ​to​ ​decentralize​ ​its​ ​products.​ ​This​ ​will​ ​give​ ​benefits​ ​of​ ​robustness, 
transparency,​ ​compatibility​ ​and​ ​scalability​ ​to​ ​Cashaa​ ​users. 

Auxesis​ ​Group 

Enterprise​ ​grade​ ​blockchain​ ​infrastructure​ ​with​ ​built-in​ ​capabilities​ ​disrupting​ ​businesses​ ​and​ ​impacting 
millions​ ​of​ ​population​ ​across​ ​the​ ​country.​ ​The​ ​Cashaa​ ​project​ ​is​ ​aligned​ ​with​ ​AuxLedger​ ​to​ ​use​ ​this

Agrello​ ​Foundation 

Agrello​ ​project​ ​works​ ​towards​ ​creating​ ​legally​ ​binding​ ​self​ ​aware​ ​contracts​ ​based​ ​on​ ​blockchain.​ ​Cashaa 
sees​ ​the​ ​opportunity​ ​for​ ​utilizing​ ​these​ ​for​ ​efficiency​ ​gains​ ​in​ ​decentralized​ ​trading​ ​and​ ​​ ​microfinancing 
where​ ​the​ ​cost​ ​of​ ​engaging​ ​into​ ​a​ ​business​ ​relationship​ ​and​ ​writing​ ​agreements​ ​is​ ​high​ ​compared​ ​to​ ​the 
transaction​ ​value.​ ​Agrello​ ​self​ ​aware​ ​contracts​ ​combined​ ​with​ ​Agrello​ ​identity​ ​and​ ​digital​ ​signature​ ​enable 
fast​ ​and​ ​secure​ ​contract​ ​conclusion. 

Agrello​ ​CEO​ ​and​ ​co-founder​ ​Hando​ ​Rand:​ ​“​We​ ​think​ ​the​ ​Cashaa​ ​project​ ​is​ ​revolutionary​ ​in​ ​Fintech,​ ​it 
combines​ ​the​ ​potential​ ​of​ ​blockchain​ ​with​ ​vast​ ​increasing​ ​demand​ ​of​ ​P2P​ ​money​ ​transfers​ ​worldwide.​ ​We 
see​ ​huge​ ​potential​ ​in​ ​cooperation​” 

 

Qtum​ ​Foundation 

Qtum​ ​combines​ ​uniquely​ ​Bitcoin​ ​functionality​ ​with​ ​the​ ​EVM​ ​in​ ​that​ ​it​ ​allows​ ​to​ ​use​ ​the​ ​UTXO​ ​protocol 
together​ ​with​ ​SPV​ ​so​ ​that​ ​it​ ​is​ ​possible​ ​to​ ​work​ ​only​ ​with​ ​the​ ​headers​ ​of​ ​transactions.​ ​Differently​ ​to 
Ethereum,​ ​this​ ​allows​ ​for​ ​the​ ​use​ ​of​ ​lite​ ​wallets​ ​that​ ​also​ ​run​ ​on​ ​mobile​ ​devices. 

Qtum​ ​Chief​ ​Scientist​ ​Alex​ ​Norta:​ ​​“Cashaa​ ​can​ ​leverage​ ​the​ ​Qtum​ ​smart-contract​ ​system​ ​by​ ​developing

5.​ ​Products 
As a product-driven company our focus is to solve the problems using disruptive technologies to create                

products and services for simple and easy use. At Cashaa we work to build the next generation of                  

consumer-centric payments and banking products on target to be the most cost-effective and innovative              

available​ ​on​ ​the​ ​market.  

 

5.1​ ​Wallets 
 

Cashaa Wallet will be a one stop destination for users to use existing and other planned services. Products                  

will be added as Cashaa secures the appropriate licences. For this purpose we are also partnering with                 

existing institutions to leverage their licenses where required. ​Cashaa ​Wallet is an alternative to traditional               
banking with a better way to spend, save and share your money, fee-free and straight from your mobile.                  

The Cashaa App can accesses a global payments network that enables worldwide acceptance of the digital                

wallet. Our digital local currency account is a gateway to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, pairing it               

with​ ​access​ ​to​ ​mainstream​ ​financial​ ​services​ ​and​ ​smart​ ​new​ ​features​ ​on​ ​a​ ​simple,​ ​user-friendly​ ​platform.  

The Cashaa App (called: Cashaa) will be available for free on Android or IOS shortly and is already                  

accessible​ ​through​ ​our​ ​WebApp​ ​(see​ ​milestones​ ​for​ ​more​ ​details).  

Some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​core​ ​functions​ ​of​ ​the​ ​app​ ​will​ ​be​ ​provide​ ​depending​ ​on​ ​regulatory​ ​framework​ ​and​ ​licences. 

1. KYC​ ​for​ ​customer​ ​onboarding 
2. Deposit,​ ​send,​ ​receive​ ​fiat​ ​money​ ​(multi-currency​ ​wallet)

withdrawals,​ ​activate​ ​geo​ ​location​ ​based​ ​spending​ ​to​ ​prevent​ ​cloning​ ​attack,​ ​diable​ ​E​ ​commerce​ ​transactions​) 

 

5.2​ ​Physical​ ​&​ ​Virtual​ ​cards 
 

Each Cashaa Wallet includes a Cashaa prepaid card which complements the wallet. Physical prepaid cards               

are the most convenient way to connect virtual assets in the finance sphere. Through our card issuance                 

partnerships with global payment networks, cards can be accepted by more than 39 Million merchants as

well as POS terminals, the adoption of which is growing exponentially with existing 3 Million ATMs which                 

enable​ ​to​ ​withdraw​ ​cash​ ​worldwide. 

Digital Indian Case Study Results: “In India Point-of-Sale transactions saw 88 percent rise, while mobile wallets                
transactions doubled. Nearly 6.5 lakh POS machines by Public Sector Banks have been issued to merchants to benefit                  
from​ ​low​ ​rentals​ ​to​ ​promote​ ​digital​ ​transactions”.  

Some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​core​ ​functions​ ​of​ ​the​ ​card:  
1. Real​ ​time​ ​conversion​ ​from​ ​crypto​ ​to​ ​local​ ​currency​ ​at​ ​point-of-sale 
2. Chip-and-PIN​ ​EMV​ ​card

4. Accepted​ ​at​ ​merchants​ ​POS 
*​Depending on the country, product manuals will be issued including details such as the exact fee of each                  
service. 

 

5.3​ ​Micro​ ​Lending 
 

The World Bank reported that less than 1 in 10 people across the world’s low and mid-income population                  

have a documented credit history. It recommends ​using non-financial data for judging creditworthiness             
using the power of the peer-to-peer economy, which revolutionized the way people do business , and due                23

to which the financial sector has seen some impressive advancements. Cashaa microloans are small p2p               

loans that are issued by individuals on our platform. These loans can be issued by a single individual or                   

aggregated across a number of individuals who contribute a portion of the total amount . CAS tokens will                 24

be used to determine the credit score and are used as integral part of the system, explained in section                   

11.1.  

This​ ​product​ ​will​ ​serve​ ​​dual​ ​purposes​: 

1. Individuals who cannot obtain credits from a bank, or users in third world countries will be able to                  

borrow​ ​money​ ​to​ ​start​ ​small​ ​businesses​ ​or​ ​for​ ​individual​ ​needs. 
2. The second purpose is to give access to new lending opportunities. The lenders are individuals who                

pledge​ ​a​ ​certain​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​money​ ​to​ ​loan​ ​out​ ​a​ ​deserving​ ​entrepreneur​ ​in​ ​another​ ​country.  
 

Global micro and SME finance markets are growing by an average of 10-15%; while the highest growth rate                  

is​ ​expected​ ​in​ ​Asia​ ​Pacific,​ ​driven​ ​by​ ​developments​ ​in​ ​India​ ​and​ ​strong​ ​growth​ ​in​ ​the​ ​region . 25

Case​ ​Studies​ ​for​ ​Micro​ ​Finance​ ​in​ ​India​ ​and​ ​Bangladesh: 

The microfinance industry has seen tremendous growth over the past five years, growing at a 45% CAGR​[1]​.                 
It has witnessed rapid evolution with regulatory reforms post the Andhra Pradesh crisis in 2010 to regulate                 

a product, its pricing and protection of customer interest. This includes growth of regulated NBFC MFIs - a                  

special class of RBI regulated entities carrying out microfinance, the formation of the first ever               

self-regulatory organizations (SROs) of the RBI, also Aadhar based lending by NBFC MFIs and              

transformation​ ​of​ ​some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​entities​ ​into​ ​universal​ ​and​ ​small​ ​finance​ ​banks. 

The key reason for the growth of the sector has been its ability to adapt changes, showing resilience in the                    

face​ ​of​ ​challenges​ ​and​ ​an​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​maintain​ ​high​ ​repayment​ ​rates​ ​of​ ​almost​ ​99.5%.  

In Bangladesh, the Nobel Prize winning Grameen model of social collateral combined with a high touch                

model and rigorous credit bureau discipline has helped to maintain high levels of repayment for small ticket                 

sized​ ​unsecured​ ​loans . 26

 

5.3​ ​Peer-to-peer​ ​exchange​ ​​(Beta​ ​Tested) 
 

Cashaa has successfully connected a large number of individuals globally, who use the platform to trade                

cryptocurrencies across the globe without without the hassle of international payments to the seller.              

(​Traders from 141 countries in 97 different currencies registered during our beta test​). These traders               
receive local fiat currency in exchange for selling and buying cryptocurrency. The Cashaa platform will be                

equipped with portfolio management services which enables market analysis, allowing users to share             

insights on markets, display their achievements and receive trading signals. Cashaa therefore lowers             

barriers to entry in the growing FX trading market for crypto currency, and thus supports experienced and                 

new traders (traders required licences in some jurisdictions). Cashaa’s peer to peer exchange even allows               

traders to buy and sell cryptocurrency which is not available in their local country’s exchanges. (As an                 

example, users in India can buy XRP, LTC, NEO, OMG in their local INR). This will bring balance in the entire                     

crypto​ ​ecosystem​ ​and​ ​lead​ ​to​ ​systematic​ ​growth​ ​of​ ​cryptocurrency​ ​across​ ​the​ ​globe.  

Core​ ​Features: 

1. In-built​ ​crypto​ ​wallet  
2. Buy​ ​and​ ​sell​ ​cryptocurrency​ ​(cash​ ​or​ ​bank​ ​account) 
3. Genrate​ ​passcode​ ​for​ ​cash​ ​trade 
4. Location​ ​based​ ​search  
5. Sorting​ ​and​ ​filtering​ ​based​ ​on​ ​traders​ ​preferences  
6. Export​ ​reviews​ ​and​ ​rating  
7. Rate​ ​&​ ​write​ ​review​ ​for​ ​​ ​the​ ​counterparty

5.5​ ​Peer​ ​to​ ​Peer​ ​Insurance​ ​(Future) 
 

Insurance is a vital part of our everyday life and protects us from the uncertainty of life. As a fintech                    

company, it is important for Cashaa to protect its users and provide access to innovative insurance                

services. The founding concept is to have a more efficiently replicated method for a group of friends or                  

associates as to what traditional insurance companies do for a large number of strangers. This will make                 

insurance more social, cheaper and clearer, thus educating people to the social function of insurance               

coverage and leveraging on business (like product construction) models of a mixed economy to provide               

users​ ​with​ ​better​ ​service​ ​and​ ​better​ ​experience​ ​at​ ​a​ ​lower​ ​cost. 

Our smart contract enabled insurance platform can be used for insuring the household, personal liability,               

legal expenses, travel and many more. Smaller claims and deductibles will be settled by peers in the group                  

while​ ​the​ ​large​ ​claims​ ​are​ ​still​ ​covered​ ​by​ ​traditional​ ​insurers,​ ​with​ ​whom​ ​the​ ​firm​ ​partners​ ​in​ ​future. 

Our team already successfully built the first Italian peer to peer insurance[ ][ ] company backed by AIG[ ]                27 28 29

insurance products, an American multinational insurance corporation with operations in more than 80             

countries and jurisdictions. Our team’s experience will be leveraged to build this innovative product on a                

blockchain.

9.​ ​Go​ ​to​ ​Market​ ​Strategy 
 

9.1​ ​Strategic​ ​Partnerships 
 

As a fast and strategic approach to reach the remote parts of Asia & Africa, partnerships are the key                   

elements for the same. Several such partnerships are already under development and include the              

following​ ​segments,​ ​namely,  

● Partnerships with banks operating in the corridors where Cashaa successfully completed its beta             
test to ensure a successful ‘last mile’ delivery to local bank accounts, prepaid cards and other easy ways to                   

cash​ ​out​ ​at​ ​a​ ​convenient​ ​location.  
● Partnerships with government agencies to circulate Cashaa cards. ​As an example, in India, Cashaa              
will use Auxesis Group for the AuxLedger which has 53 Million users resulting of a State Government                 

partnership. 

● Partnering​ ​with​ ​agents​ ​running​ ​traditional​ ​MTO​ ​networks​ ​for​ ​Western​ ​Union,​ ​MoneyGram​ ​or​ ​Ria. 
● Partnerships with leading global telecom companies, providing immediate opportunities to start           
mobile​ ​banking​ ​products.  
● Partnerships with E-Commerce platforms for payment providers to increase coin utility. ​For            
example, a recent partnership has been signed up with one of the largest restaurant & pub search                 

company​ ​in​ ​the​ ​UK. 
● Partnering with crypto wallet providers to use their existing user base. Examples are branded              
Bitcoin​ ​wallets​ ​such​ ​as​ ​Airbitz,​ ​with​ ​whom​ ​Cashaa​ ​concluded​ ​a​ ​partnership.  
 

9.2​ ​Legal,​ ​Auditing​ ​and​ ​Regulatory​ ​Partnerships 
 

The Cashaa team’s extensive banking and payments experience helps us to know the nuts and bolts of                 

internal​ ​process​ ​and​ ​license​ ​requirements:  

● Our team is already in negotiation with companies to acquire the e-money and banking licences to                
save​ ​money​ ​and​ ​time. 
● Partnerships with banks and financial institutions to leverage their licences to speed up our process               
to go live. For example, in UK, Africa, India & EU we are leveraging our relations to use different payments                    

networks.​ ​In​ ​Europe​ ​through​ ​our​ ​strategic​ ​partnerships​ ​we​ ​are​ ​going​ ​to​ ​use​ ​the​ ​Mastercard​ ​network. 
● Working closely with auditing firms to leverage the auditability, transparency and accountability of             
the​ ​Cashaa​ ​platform​ ​to​ ​encourage​ ​its​ ​use.

10.​ ​Cashaa​ ​Tokens​ ​and​ ​Token​ ​Generation​ ​Event  
 

A Token generation event (TGE) will be conducted i.e. an event in which early adopters and enthusiasts

Cashaa’s token generation event is one of the few backed by a ​unique proven platform with a team that                   
has more than 200 Years of Payments and Banking experience and successful entrepreneurs who built their                

companies from scratch which are now part of Fortune Top 15 companies​. Cashaa’s model has been

separate document setting out the terms and conditions of the agreement as between the distributor               

and you in relation to the Cashaa Token generation event . In the event of any inconsistencies between                  

the T&Cs and this Whitepaper, the former shall prevail. The Distributor will be an affiliate of Cashaa, and                  

all funds raised in connection with the Cashaa Token generation event will be deployed to fund Cashaa                 

cryptocurrency​ ​project,​ ​businesses​ ​and​ ​operations.  
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we” or “us” in connection with the Cashaa Token                

generation​ ​event​ ​​ ​shall​ ​be​ ​construed​ ​as​ ​references​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Distributor.

10.1​ ​Token​ ​Functionality

upcoming​ ​services​ ​in​ ​the​ ​CAS​ ​ecosystem.​ ​CAS​ ​serves​ ​two​ ​main​ ​objectives:​ ​First,​ ​the​ ​token​ ​is​ ​the​ ​fuel​ ​of​ ​an 
internal​ ​mechanism​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Cashaa​ ​ecosystem.​ ​Second,​ ​it​ ​is​ ​part​ ​of​ ​the​ ​governance​ ​component​ ​of​ ​the​ ​CAS 
system.​ ​Each​ ​Cashaa​ ​wallet​ ​is​ ​initially​ ​equipped​ ​with​ ​a​ ​predefined​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​CAS​ ​and​ ​cannot​ ​be​ ​used 
without​ ​a​ ​minimum​ ​CAS​ ​balance.

● Providing​ ​the​ ​credit​ ​score​ ​for​ ​lenders​ ​(Micro​ ​Finance) 
● Ability​ ​to​ ​participate​ ​in​ ​governing​ ​mechanism​ ​of​ ​CAS​ ​usage​ ​(Governance) 
● Secure​ ​P2P​ ​money​ ​transfers​ ​(Escrow) 

 

10.1.2​ ​Acquiring​ ​tokens 
● Token​ ​distribution 
● Secondary​ ​markets 
● Rewards​ ​collection 

10.1.3​ ​Spending​ ​tokens 

10.1.3.1​ ​Membership

● Higher​ ​FX​ ​transfer​ ​(Spend,​ ​transfer​ ​and​ ​exchange​ ​an​ ​unlimited​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​money​ ​anywhere​ ​in​ ​the

● Early​ ​adopter​ ​rewards​ ​and​ ​beta​ ​access 

10.1.3.2​ ​Microfinance​ ​&​ ​Credit​ ​Score 
 

CAS token holders will be able to access instant loans at low interest rates compared to non token holders,                   
and​ ​will​ ​also​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​give​ ​loans.  
For the borrower, CAS ownership leads to improved loan conditions, rewarding users for taking a larger                
stake in the Cashaa system. CAS tokens can be both earned or bought, respectively improving the owner`s                 
creditworthiness.  
For each loan paid back in time and fulfilling any specific conditions, borrowers are rewarded with CAS, the                  
accumulation of which improves the credit score of low credit rated individuals and small businesses               
anywhere​ ​in​ ​the​ ​world. 
Another​ ​way​ ​to​ ​receive​ ​improved​ ​lending​ ​conditions​ ​is​ ​via​ ​other​ ​users​ ​vouching​ ​with​ ​their​ ​own​ ​CAS​ ​tokens. 
In this case, following a fulfilment of all repayment criteria, both the borrower and the voucher are                 
rewarded​ ​with​ ​CAS​ ​tokens.  
Finally, in addition to receiving paid interest rates, lenders can earn CAS tokens by providing loans as a                  
reward for their risk. To facilitate lenders’ decision making, each user`s credit score will be available online.                 
In case any of the involved entities fails to fulfill their duties of the lending agreement, the provided CAS                   
tokens are confiscated by the smart contract. Furthermore, users can sell or donate their CAS tokens to                 
other​ ​users​ ​directly,​ ​thereby​ ​improving​ ​the​ ​receiver`s​ ​credit​ ​score​ ​and​ ​losing​ ​their​ ​own. 
 
 
10.1.3.3​ ​Trading  
 
Only traders with enough CAS can participate in the trading network and are entitled to create smart                 

contracts for trading. In the existing Cashaa system when a money sender puts their request to transfer                 

money,​ ​a​ ​seller​ ​and​ ​buyer​ ​compete​ ​for​ ​the​ ​local​ ​fiat​ ​in​ ​exchange​ ​of​ ​cryptocurrencies.  
For example, a money sender puts a request on our platform to transfer £1000 from London to New Delhi.                   

Based on the FX and proprietary algorithm Cashaa calculates the best possible rates and gives the users                 

e.g. INR 84,000. Cashaa immediately splits the lead into two parts where all crypto traders in London get                  

notified and see on the platform that they have an option to receive £1000 for X BTC. In the same way,                     

buyers will see their option to buy Y BTC by paying INR 84,000. To accept the deal the seller has to put                      

100% of X BTC into a uniquely created escrow wallet, while the buyer has to put 10% of Y BTC into the                      

escrow. The system generates two passcodes which are used by the money sender and seller in London &                  

buyer and receiver in New Delhi to verify themselves respectively. In section 3 we presented the case how                  

this​ ​system​ ​helps​ ​to​ ​create​ ​a​ ​win​ ​win​ ​situation​ ​for​ ​both​ ​parties. 
Replacing the buyer escrow with CAS will allow multi cryptocurrency exchanges by removing the              

dependency on the crypto which the traders respectively decided to trade. Traders will be allowed to                

execute the smart contract which will hold the required CAS. As this mechanism will allow traders to buy                  

and sell any cryptocurrency, it will boost the supply of cryptocurrencies in the countries where exchanges                

currently do not support them, and balance it with countries where they are in surplus. Balancing the                 

entire ecosystem in this way can bring a systematic growth of cryptocurrency across the globe, e.g. Cashaa                 

traders​ ​in​ ​India​ ​will​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​buy​ ​LTC,​ ​NEO,​ ​BAT​ ​etc​ ​in​ ​INR.

10.1.4​ ​Governance​ ​mechanism 
 

1. Governing voting system is another objective of the CAS token. The governance mechanism is              

executed by stakeholders. Stakeholders are technological and business partners to Cashaa project, non             

profit organizations of the industry, advisors and some token holders. Stakeholders vote on how much of                

the​ ​company​ ​revenue​ ​will​ ​be​ ​used​ ​to​ ​buy​ ​the​ ​tokens​ ​from​ ​the​ ​exchange​ ​on​ ​a​ ​regular​ ​base.  
2. CAS stakeholders can also vote on requests to update Cashaa token contracts which hold the               

vesting period of company tokens. Each user’s voting depends on the proportion of owned CAS token                

compared to the available tokens in market. The company will present reasons and benefits of doing so at                  

Bitcointalk or other media, and a smart contract based voting will be conducted to unlock the vesting                 

period.

10.4​ ​Token​ ​Distribution 
 

Cashaa Limited affiliates will issue a one-time total of 1 Billion CAS, which is distributed into three                 
categories,​ ​using​ ​an​ ​Ethereum​ ​based​ ​smart​ ​contract.

Cashaa’s​ ​token​ ​sale​ ​​ ​(both​ ​pre-token​ ​sale​ ​​ ​and​ ​main​ ​token​ ​sale​ ​). 
There​ ​is​ ​a​ ​fundraising​ ​cap​ ​of​ ​​ ​$​ ​32​ ​Million​ ​USD. 
At Cashaa, we consider it as a strong signal of trust if the community

Company 24% 240,000,000 CAS will be held in reserve by Cashaa in order to fund             
the future transactions and expand the liquidity pool required for          
future growth and expansion. The fund will be locked by the smart            
contract and will be governed by the CAS community based on the            
requirement.  

Community  5% 50,000,000 CAS will be used for bounty programs and community          
initiatives to reward community members (developers, entrepreneurs       
strategists, etc) who will expand or leverage the Cashaa network to

move, which will give Cashaa the benefit of significant increases in           

revenues from improved market share and forex transactions.        

Post token distribution, Cashaa will evaluate applying for required         

banking licenses across different geographies to create an even,         

strong compliance and better user experience to gradually        

integrate multiple currencies into the Cashaa platform. A focused

3) While adding more services, further licenses in the UK, USA,           

India & South Africa will be applied for, including an E-Money           

license (assuming $15 M sold) and a Commercial Banking license          

in​ ​Europe​ ​(assuming​ ​$20​ ​M​ ​sold)  

4) Insurance product related clearance will start with insurance

so in the future. Being in the blockchain ecosystem and adhering           

to the highest standards entails certain operational costs        

associated with accounting and administrative overheads to meet        

the​ ​requirements​ ​for​ ​a​ ​growing​ ​international​ ​business.

Customer 

Support 

10% Cashaa will expand its multi-channel customer support team to         

include 24/7 support in all local languages where Cashaa is          

operating. This will ensure high level customer experience and         

detailed guidance available on each process’ steps for both money          

senders​ ​and​ ​traders. 

 

 

10.7​ ​Token​ ​Support 

The Cashaa team is dedicated to support the participants during the token distribution process. Typically,               

funds will be deposited with an escrow until the user releases the funds to the receiver. For every offer                   

made, a smart contract is automatically created. Users deposit tokens to the escrow as a guarantee for a                  

successful transaction. If there is a dispute in the transaction, the user will not release the funds, and can                   

start the process of resolving the dispute. One of the ways to resolve such disputes will be to contact the                    

Cashaa​ ​Support​ ​Team​ ​at​ ​​Tokensupport@cashaa.com​. 

 

10.8​ ​Assurance​ ​&​ ​Security 

Blockchain technology enables a secure, smart-contract based escrow for all transactions, along with             

ensuring that everything is done so that no exploits exist within the code. TokenMarket, a Top ICO                 

management platform, will manage the Token distribution and execution of smart contract to ensure the               

proper security of the tokens. The smart contracts written by Token Market will also be reviewed with                 

external​ ​auditor​ ​​​ ​​to​ ​ensure​ ​best​ ​security​ ​for​ ​our​ ​token​ ​sale​ ​participants.
