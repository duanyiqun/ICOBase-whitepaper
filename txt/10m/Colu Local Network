1. INTRODUCTION 
 

 

The Internet is making its way into every part of our  lives.  With the speed of adoption 

increasing, technical barriers are being lowered and we find  our  physical and digital lives 

beginning to integrate, creating a huge impact, especially on  millennials. They are the 

first digital-native generation to be born into this  world and the largest generation in 

history—significantly larger than the baby-boomer generation, and are expected to be in 

control of 24 trillion dollars of the world's wealth by 2020. They are more likely to live in 

cities, they own fewer cars, and they choose their brands based on  values like ethical 

sourcing, social justice, and environmental effects. They are looking for meaning, and 

often find it in making a positive impact on  the community around them, thus creating a 

demand for financial community ties. 

 

Technology is dramatically changing the way millennials make payments and consume 

other financial services. As physical cash is being replaced by digital means, from cards 

to mobile, they come to expect payments to be quick, safe, cool to use, and available 

24/7. This creates pressure on merchants to broaden the means of payments they 

accept, in an effort to catch up with user demand. This pressure is especially 

burdensome for smaller merchants in today’s environment as they often pay the highest 

fees for payment processing, making for an uneven playing field for local initiatives. 

 

Moreover, as a consequence of accelerating globalization, the diminishing frictions in 

cross-border commerce have incentivized corporate rent extraction through 

cost-externalization and the outsourcing of production. Encouraged by the continuation 

of open policies on multilateral trade, global supply chains have penetrated domestic 

markets, resulting in the incremental centralization of capital flows toward multinational 

organizations.​[1] ​ While the free movement of goods is imperative to open markets, SMEs 

(small to medium size enterprises) get the short end of the stick, being unable to 

compete in their native markets. In particular, small businesses with less than 10 

employees make up over 93 percent of all enterprises in the EU and account for around 

two-thirds of employment.​[2]  ​In the US, small businesses account for 99.7 percent of firms 

with paid employees, and annually contribute almost 40 percent of US private, non-farm 

output.​[3]​ ​ ​Yet, these small businesses often face difficulties accessing capital.   

   



3 

A comparison study published by the OECD shows that the share of SME loans in  

total business loans in 2014 was 22.5% in the UK, 21.2% in the US and France, and  

14.2% in Canada.​[4] 

 

Community financial service providers typically provide services to SMEs and consumers 

based on “relationship banking”; however, they encounter tough competition from large 

national and multinational financial institutions. Credit unions and community banks play 

an important role in the US by lending to small businesses and providing access to 

payments services for a large percentage of the population. However, their share in total 

deposits and loans has been decreasing significantly over the years.​[5]​ Credit unions are 

typically another type of community financial service provider. A study in Canada shows 

that they retain a higher share of net income to support future growth and investment in 

creating jobs, that they provide loans through periods where availability of credit is low, 

and that they lead in SME business lending. 

 

The idea of a community currency as a secondary medium of exchange, store of value, 

and unit of account has also been around for a while.​  ​Community currencies have 

attracted attention from academics and policy makers alike, due to their unique ability  

to produce and retain wealth within communities.​[6] ​These currencies have the potential 

to increase overall profitability for  local stakeholders and to facilitate countercyclical 

growth cycles and increased social welfare.​[7]  ​Several projects have attempted to 

establish local payment systems; however, due to lack of sufficient infrastructure these 

initiatives have failed to provide a secure, liquid, and scalable environment for 

financial transactions.​[8] 

 

Technological advancements, notably the emergence of blockchain technology, lower 

the barriers to offering payment processing solutions and establishing local payments 

systems. While the macroeconomic consequences of issuing digital peer-to-peer 

currencies remain hypothetical, regulators are exploring opportunities in distributed 

financial solutions.​[9]  ​As the notion of digital currency manifests itself in private and 

regulatory institutions, the efficiency, resilience, and accessibility of disintermediated 

digital payment infrastructure is gaining momentum with a broader audience. The CLN is 

looking to build an ecosystem that will combine the two changes discussed 

above—technological and social—by creating a network that supports the evolution of 

local payment systems, each of which provides incentives to its local stakeholders, while 

sharing tools and services provided over the entire network.  

   



4 

A fresh approach to community “banking” using blockchain technology, where 

transactions are verified P2P  and intermediaries are removed, shows the promising 

potential to generate value by increasing competition on the price, quality, and variety of 

services relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services. 

 

Colu is firmly rooted in the open-source blockchain developer community as a leading 

member of the​ ​ColoredCoins​ ​p​roject, and is investing additional resources in open-source 

code with the latest release of​ ​Bankbox​.​ This commitment is also reflected in the initial 

release of the Colu Local Wallet.

2.  GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CLN 
NETWORK AND PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
  
 
The current state of payment systems globally, even in well-developed markets such as 

the UK and the US,  is such that the gap between end-user needs, both of consumers and 

of businesses, and what is being delivered by the current payments infrastructure is 

growing and creating significant detriment for users, who are demanding greater control, 

greater assurance, enhanced data, and reduced financial crime.​[10]​ A recent report by the 

Payments Strategy Forum in the UK, identifies key requirements that current legacy 

systems and the entire payment infrastructure must meet:​[11] 

 

● The ability to respond to current and future end-user needs 

● Improving trust in the safety and certainty of payments 

● Simplifying access to data and to systems in order to promote competition   

● A new architecture for the payment ecosystem 

 

In thinking of a new architecture for the payment ecosystem, one that can support us in 

achieving the desired goals given today’s technologies, a recent dedicated report (the 

“NPA Report”) details a proposed conceptual framework.​[12]​  The guidelines listed in the 

NPA report include: 

 

● A single set of standards and rules with strong central governance 

● End-to-end interoperability (including Application Programming Interfaces and 

common messaging standards) 

● A collaborative infrastructure, allowing multiple providers of overlay services to 

compete in the market simultaneously 

● The need to ensure our payment systems are secure and resilient with financial 

stability as a key foundation 

 

Somewhat surprisingly, both regulators and traditional financial players on the one hand, 

and disruptive innovators in the blockchain arena on the other, agree on most of the 

above guidelines, with the notable exception of the form of governance.   

 



6 

The blockchain space is currently experimenting with different methods of community 

governance, but it is already clear that this technology offers new capabilities that are not 

possible in the financial system when it comes to transparency and the ability to 

coordinate a large group of organizations around an open and secure protocol. 

 

The proposed CLN network implements an infrastructure that will facilitate the evolution 

of an ecosystem that adheres to many of the above principles: 

● The choice to develop the CLN as an open-source project​ ​on a public blockchain 

implies there is a  transparent set of standards and rules that ensures 

interoperability.  

● Moreover, the existence of a vibrant, fast-growing community of developers 

facilitates the emergence of overlay services offered by third parties that will 

compete on the network. This is evident by the Ethereum transaction volume, 

which has already surpassed Bitcoin’s transaction volume by allowing new 

functionality that has attracted thousands of companies to develop on top of it. 

● A new network evolving over the blockchain is more prone to being dynamic and 

adaptive to future end-consumer needs than would be any result of a mere 

transformation of  an old network built, as it is, on the foundation of legacy 

systems owned and operated by traditional players. 

● The ability to bypass the network or fork it and make changes where it is proving 

to be inefficient or failing to create value for end consumers provides ongoing, 

healthy competitive pressure on the network. Such competitive pressure is often 

missing in many other proprietary payment schemes owned and operated by 

banks and credit card companies. 

 

2.1. THE BUSINESS MODEL AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CLN NETWORK 
The key business goals that the CLN network is designed to support are: 

● Providing economic incentives that will facilitate the development and provision of 

new services to the network 

● Providing services in an accessible manner, which will support broad adoption of 

the technology (“bringing the use of crypto currencies to the masses”) 

● Using economic incentives as a growth engine by facilitating the introduction of 

community currencies [See Chapter 3 for details] 

 

The importance of designing the network in such a way that it will organically provide 

adequate incentives to the various participants in order to facilitate broad adoption is also 

reflected in a recent report by the US Faster Payments Task Force concerning the design 



7 

of a faster payments system in the US.​[13]​ The report discusses the need to provide 

incentives to consumers and merchants to encourage them to learn, access, and use  

the system, and to provide solution operators and service providers with incentives to 

develop and deliver solutions and participate in an ecosystem that enables interoperability 

among competing solutions. Moreover, the report acknowledges the importance of 

enabling financial service providers of all sizes to participate and deliver solutions “by 

fostering competitive fairness, continued innovation, and flexibility to take advantage of 

emerging technologies.” Therefore, the network should be structured to provide incentives 

to entities providing those financial services that address everyday needs, entities often 

referred to as gateways.  

 

The CLN network proposes a framework via which to provide incentives using blockchain 

technology. Next, we discuss the multiple stakeholders that could participate in the CLN 

network and the fundamental role they each play in establishing, developing for,  and 

maintaining the network, on the one hand, and in using the services provided, on the other. 

The incentives to the various players would be provided through the circulation of the 

network’s native token (CLN) and community currencies in the form of rewards or fees.

Role 

 
Description 

 
Financial 

Gateways 

 
A financial gateway accepts fiat or crypto deposits from users, and acts as a 

custodian for user funds flowing in and out of the network. A gateway can be 

any institution, including financial institution, as long as it provides services 

that accompany the custody of consumers funds, such as KYC and other 

regulatory requirements. Gateways act as entry and exit points for fiat 

currencies. They are in a position to play a vital role in the network by 

providing transaction verification and settlement across the network, without 

a central operator and without reliance on a single gateway. Gateways are 

compensated for their services in CLN fees. 

 
Community 

Currency 

Issuers 

 
A community currency issuer uses the tools provided by the CLN network to 

issue a community currency for its community and provide liquidity for it. This 

role can be taken by merchant networks, local businesses, consumer clubs, and 

other entities that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate 

consumption, payments, lending, crowdfunding, or credit. 

 
Developers and 

Service 

Providers 

 
Developers and service providers will build tools and services on top of the 

 CLN network, enhancing its capabilities. The network will support partnerships 

with products or other networks that complement the CLN network’s services, 

such as credit providers, credit-scoring service providers, or integrators to 

legacy networks. 

 
Merchants 

 
Local merchants accept fiat payments for the services they provide. Merchants 

are rewarded in their community currency for transactions that take place at 

their point of sale. 

 
End-users 

 
Consumers pay at merchants’ point of sale with digital fiat currency. They  

are rewarded in their community currency for pursuing this economic activity 

on the network.

2.2. NETWORK CAPABILITIES FOR ISSUERS AND GATEWAYS 
Issuers are entities that issue cryptocurrencies and provide them with liquidity. This role 

can be taken by merchant networks, local businesses, consumer clubs, and other entities 

that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate consumption, payments, 

lending, crowdfunding, or credit. Issuers are at the heart of the network, and they are 

also in a position to act as gateways, although it is not mandatory. The network will 

launch with two key functionalities for issuers—the ability to issue community currencies 

using a template that is easy for developers to use and to provide a smooth exchange 

between community currencies, as well as ERC-20 tokens, via the CLN token. Both 

functionalities will be implemented using a set of smart contracts. 

→The issuer tools are discussed in detail in Section 3. 

  

2.3 PROPOSED  ARCHITECTURE OF THE CLN NETWORK 
A successful token is one with a distribution pattern that creates a system of incentives 

that support the business goals set for the token. For the CLN, it is creating a token that 

provides access to a network of local payments. The CLN token allows financial 

gateways, developers, and service providers to make payments, exchange between 

currencies, and provide additional services that address local communities’ needs, thus 

providing an alternative to traditional financial institutions. Moreover, the goal of 

community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities, connecting 

consumers and businesses.  

 

In the previous section we discussed the network capabilities for issuers and gateways. 

We refer to these capabilities as the issuer layer. Next, we discuss how the proposed 

architecture enables two layers of services that facilitate various stages in the payment 

process to be developed on top of the issuer layer. 



10 

 

 
 

2.3.1. Products and services layer 
Products and services developed by anyone in the community could be integrated  

to the network as the network is an open-source public blockchain. The development of 

payment processing capabilities will provide merchants with an easy, bundled API/SDK  

to collect payments made using all types of payment means, including POS or 

e-commerce. Payment processing services will also support innovation in advanced 

payment types—for example, the introduction of recurring payments or of decentralized 

fiat exchange between gateways. Merchant services will handle merchant-related 

operations, such as the generation of invoices or fund withdrawals to the merchant’s 

bank account. Any operation using SDK tools will pay the applicable gateway or service 

provider a fee in CLN. 

 

 

   



11 

The goal of using community currencies as rewards to facilitate payments in fiat between 

consumers and merchants is enabled by the network architecture, which allows for the 

development of the capability to issue crypto-fiat pegged to the corresponding fiat 

money by gateways holding fiat deposits.​[14] 

 

 

2.3.2 Clients Layer  
The clients layer interfaces with end-users—consumers and merchants. Tokens issued 

on the CLN network will be compatible with any Ethereum wallet. A key requirement of 

this layer is that it is independent of the CLN network. The CLN network will incentivize 

many potential players to build clients on top of the CLN, and it will be attractive thanks 

to the capabilities it will provide for processing fiat payments and cryptocurrencies. The 

freedom of clients to bypass the CLN network in order to process payments will drive the 

CLN network to focus on providing value-added services that reduce the technical 

barriers and increase usability of payments on the blockchain. 

 

 
 

   



12 

 

3. THE ROLE AND DESIGN OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES 
 

The CLN network lowers the barriers that stakeholders are facing when attempting to 

launch and maintain a new financial system in their community by providing them with 

tools and services that make it easier to launch a new digital payment infrastructure  

and design the growth engines that will make it flourish. 

 

Community currencies that could be issued on the CLN network, may be used to offer 

incentives to end-users in the community (consumers and merchants) as well as 

developers and service providers. Thus community currencies could support an organic 

reward scheme for transactions being made within the community. The community 

currency will be issued by community gateways, with a transparent supply schedule  

and distribution rules.  

 

The community currency will serve as an alternative medium of exchange and store of 

value, allowing users to transact with it freely with any Ethereum-compatible wallet. In 

order to create a mechanism that allows this functionality, the CLN network will provide 

two main network tools:  

 

Issuance—​Community currencies will be issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, 

leveraging Ethereum smart contract capabilities to set and enforce business rules like 

milestone-based access to funds for issuers. This will remove  the current need for users 

to have blind trust in issuers. Any deviation from,  or agreed change in, supply or 

governance is visible and verifiable by the public. 

 

Liquidity provision​—Providing liquidity for newly issued currencies requires major effort, 

and is addressed by the automatic market-making contract. In order for the community 

currency vision to be realised there is a need for liquidity, so that supply and demand 

forces will manifest in the price. This is achieved by leveraging smart contracts’ 

capabilities and by using the CLN as a reserve currency. 

 

 

   



13 

The CLN network thus solves the fundamental chicken-and-egg problem, as engaged 

communities will be able to launch currencies regardless of their size, location, or 

transactional volume. In doing so, they will be able to benefit from having access to a 

decentralized group of stakeholders and service providers that take on a variety of roles  

in the value chain. The implication is an open-source and distributed financial framework, 

facilitating a safe and transparent payment system, accessible to all.  

 

 
3.1 THE ISSUANCE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES 
 

 
Community currencies will be issued by stakeholders within the community. These 

stakeholders will have a vested interest in the success of the community. Organizations 

like community banks, credit unions, merchants’ associations and  the like are potential 

issuers. We refer to these organizations as community issuers. All communities will be 

interconnected through the CLN. 

 

Each community issuer can launch a new community currency for its local community. 

The issuance and allocation process will be transparent and publicly verifiable using an 

Ethereum smart contract. The currency will be an ERC-20 token that will be compliant 

with any Ethereum wallet. 

 

As part of the issuance process the issuer locks a certain amount of CLN  in an automatic 

market-making contract. The lock-in of CLNs releases a portion of  community currency 

tokens to the issuer and establishes an “issuance price” for the community currency. 

That is, the amount of CLNs locked in by the issuer determines the initial value of the 

local community, measured by the product of the amount of circulating tokens and the 

issuance price. From this point onwards, this price evolves according to the flow of 

trades sent by anyone to the market making contract. If the issuer chooses not to lock 

any CLNs in the reserve of the market making contract, the issuance price is set to zero 

and all community currency tokens are locked in the contract initially, implying a starting 

value of zero to the community. Any appreciation in value from this point onwards will be 

as a result of demand for the community currency, paid for in CLNs.  

 

In fact the issuer can allow investors to participate in the issuance process and 

receive community currency tokens in exchange for their investment in CLNs. See 

Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the process. 

 



14 

The two reserves established by the issuance process will provide a functionality of 

exchange, and thus liquidity, for community currencies, without having to list these 

currencies on centralized exchanges in the early stages, during which the potential value 

of doing so is relatively small. 

 

The issuance process of a community currency could allow a milestone-based process 

for the allocation of CLN funds received and tokens issued. This supports an alignment 

of interests whereby additional community currency is released to a community issuer as 

the economic activity in the community—measured, for example, by the volume of 

transactions—increases, in order to cover their growing operational costs. 

 

As the community currency network expands, new issuers and gateways will integrate into 

the network. Through the CLN network, financial institutions and companies will be able to 

offer value-added services, further stimulating local economic development and growth. 

 

 
3.2 THE PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY FOR COMMUNITY CURRENCIES 
 
Once a local payment system, supported by a community currency, is up and running, it 

will generate value by increasing competition on the price, quality, and variety of services 

relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services. However, this value 

will have to be built up over time, and be reflected in the value of the community 

currency. Consequently, consumers and merchants will likely value the option to 

exchange a community currency for the CLN network token or for other cryptocurrencies 

that can be used as means of payment or stores of value. Furthermore, participants may 

want to convert these tokens to fiat money. 

 

However, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient liquidity for community currencies at 

their inception. Participants looking to exchange community currencies may not find a 

counterparty to trade with. On a typical exchange, the price of the asset is determined in 

response to the supply of and demand for the traded asset, and so the price reflects a 

willing exchange between a buyer and a seller. While there is no way to mimic the 

behavior of such an exchange mechanically, the CLN network will provide the community 

currency gateway with a tool that allows it to act as a market maker for the community 

currency, from the time of issuance. It will do so by executing exchange transactions 

automatically using a smart contract according to a preset formula. We will refer to this 

process as “mechanical market making”.  



15 

 

There are a number of important features that a liquidity model should satisfy. First, as 

argued above, it is important to realize that mechanical market making, predetermined 

and “set in stone” (or smart contract), cannot mimic the behavior of a real-time market 

exchange. In fact, hypothetically, were the community currencies to be traded on an 

exchange, there could be a gap between the exchange rate on the exchange and the 

one determined by the mechanical market-making contract. Therefore, it is important that 

the way that the contracts are implemented should not prevent the CLN and the 

community currencies from being traded on exchanges (other than through the 

mechanical market maker) or prevent other entities from providing an exchange service 

in parallel (i.e., function as competing market makers for community currencies). 

Moreover, the model should not create unfair conditions that would preclude this in 

practice. Consequently, we find it preferable that the mechanism should not have the 

authority or capability to alter the amount of community currency issued through the 

operation of liquidity provision. Otherwise, the ability of the mechanism to issue or 

destroy tokens in the process and affect the value of the currency could potentially harm 

the incentives to others to provide liquidity, and could potentially be used to manipulate 

the exchange rate. Moreover, the more available means there are for arbitrageurs to 

correct a mis-pricing caused by mechanical market making relative to the market 

perception, the smaller such possible gaps in pricing are likely to be. 

 

Second, the model should mimic the basic behavior of a market, and therefore should 

posses the following characteristics: 

● When there is demand for a community currency its price (relative to the CLN) 

should increase, and vice versa when there is demand for CLN in exchange for 

the community currency. 

● There should be sufficient liquidity to execute each trade. Our proposal is to 

maintain two reserves—one in CLN and another in the community currency—that 

are dedicated to serve as a counterparty for each exchange transaction.  

● The price instrument should be used to implement the above characteristics, and 

in particular to ensure that the reserves do not exhaust themselves in the 

process, unless the entire money supply from one side is being added to the 

reserve (in which case it can exhaust the reserve on the other side). 

● The price is only a function of the state of the two reserves and other fixed 

parameters (e.g., the amount of tokens issued in total). Therefore, whenever 

reserves are in the same state, the exchange price should be the same.  



16 

The equations that will be used to set the exchange rate for a community currency 

against the CLN are provided in the appendix. We show that they maintain this set of 

desired properties. We note that the model is inspired by a model presented in an article 

titled “Dealership Market - Market-Making with Inventory” by Amihud & Mendelson.  The 1

article presents a dealership market which is dominated by a single centralized 

market-maker. The possible temporal discrepancy between market buy and sell orders, 

and the obligation to maintain continuous trading, induce the market-maker to carry an 

inventory of the stock. The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the quoted bid and 

ask prices on the market-maker’s inventory. The paper establishes that the optimal policy 

is one where prices are monotone decreasing functions of the inventory at hand. In the 

case of linear demand and supply for the stock, transition rates in each state, which 

respect a one-to-one correspondence with the bid and ask prices, satisfy an ellipse 

equation. 

 

 

3.3 THE USE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES AS REWARDS  
FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
 

The goal of community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities by 

connecting consumers and businesses.  Thus we envision that the distribution of 

community currency will be carried out through purchasing transactions taking place at a 

brick-and-mortar merchant’s terminal, as this form of distribution implements the focus of 

the CLN network on strengthening economic activity in local economies. To facilitate this, 

a portion of each transaction at a merchant’s terminal will be subtracted from the 

payment to the merchant and allocated, as a ​reward in community currency​, to the 

consumer and the merchant involved in the transaction for their economic activity in the 

community and on the network. In particular, when a consumer conducts a transaction 

using digital-fiat or crypto-fiat, a portion of the fiat payment will be exchanged to CLN and 

then to community currency using the market-making contract before being allocated to 

the parties. The use of the community currency in this manner will allow the network to 

offer a competitive alternative to traditional financial models.

4. SUMMARY 
 

 
The CLN creates a decentralized network of tools and services that support community 

payment systems. Through the introduction of community currencies, the CLN network 

creates a potential link between the economic activity taking place at brick-and-mortar 

merchants within the community,  which is facilitated by fiat payments (whether digital or 

crypto-fiat), and the distribution of the community currency among stakeholders as a reward 

for engaging in this economic activity. The CLN network provides a platform for currency 

issuers and local gateways to support payments for goods and services  and provide other 

financial services. Therefore, community currencies lower the barriers for communities to 

upgrade their payment infrastructure and reduce costs to intermediaries.

APPENDIX A—MATHEMATICAL EQUATION FOR THE MECHANICAL  

MARKET-MAKING CONTRACT 

 

The mechanical market-making contract is a formula that adjusts the exchange rate 
between two tokens—the CLN and a community currency—based on the total supply of 
tokens from each and the state of the reserves in each currency,  which the contract 
controls. The reserves and the price evolve over time in response to demand for the 
tokens. The formula has a number of desired properties. 
  
Given the total supply of the two tokens S​1​,S​2​, the reserves owned by the contract for the 
two tokens, denoted by  R​1​ and R​2​ , must satisfy at any time the following equation: 
 

Eq (1):  
 
Alternatively stated, denote the percentage of tokens circulating outside the reserve of 
the contract by 

 , then 
 

. In particular, given the reserve in Token1 R​1​, which determines ​x​, we can 
express ​y​ and the reserve of Token2 

,  
 
and this determines R​2​ in return, 

 
 
Note that given that starting conditions for the two reserves satisfy the relationship 
above,  the reserve of either of the tokens exhausts itself only when the entire supply of 2

the other token is put into the opposite reserve—that is, 
 

 and ,  
 
or, alternatively stated, when R​1​=S​1 ​ it implies R​2​=0 and, symmetrically, when R​2​=S​2 ​ then 
R​1​=0. 
 
 

2 The smart contract responsible for the issuance of a new community currency ensures 

that starting conditions are satisfied. This is discussed in detail in Appendix B.

To derive the price of Token1, differentiate Eq (1) with respect to R​1​, 

 
 

 
 
Price can also be expressed in terms of ​x​ and ​y​, 

 
 
Note that when the limit cases are approached, the price approaches zero or 

infinity—that is, when  
 
R​1​=S​1​ then P=0, and when R​1​=0 then P​1​ approaches infinity. 
 
The smart contract needs to calculate for any amount E1 of Token1 sent to the contract, 
and thus added to the reserve of Token1, the corresponding amount E​2​ (in Token2) to be 
released from the reserve in exchange. 
 

 
s.t. 

 

 

 
 
To understand the price behavior, we can derive the percentage change in the price of 
Token 2 in response to an amount E​1​ of Token1 sent to be exchanged. Assume that 
before the exchange of E​1​, 

  
 
This can be expressed as

Thus the percentage change in the price of Token2 can be expressed as 

  
 
As can be seen from the equation, the percentage price change depends on the size of 
the reserve relative to the total supply of Token1, and on the size of the amount sent to 
be exchanged relative to the size of the reserve. 
 
Alternatively, we can derive an expression for the percentage price change when E​1​ is

APPENDIX B—MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF A 
COMMUNITY CURRENCY AND THE LOCK-UP OF INITIAL RESERVES 

  
 
The process 
We want to define the parameters that an issuer has to provide the smart contract in 
order to facilitate a process that: a) issues a community currency, and b) establishes a 
two-side reserve in the CLN (Token 1) and in the community currency (Token 2). Denote 
the total supply of CLN by S​1​. There are two types of issuance procedures: 

● Where CLN tokens are sent to the issuance contract by the issuer, referred to as 
“issuance with issuer’s own fund” 

● Where the issuer specifies certain parameters for the issuance, but CLN tokens 
are sent to the contract by “investors” (i.e., any CLN token holder), referred to as 
“issuance with investors’ funds” 

 
Issuance with issuer’s own funds 
When issuing using this option, the issuer follows certain steps. 

● Step 1: The issuer specifies to the contract the desired amount of tokens to issue, 
S​2​. The contract issues the tokens and locks them in the reserve—that is to say, 
R​2​=S​2​. This sets the price of Token 2 to zero, as  

 where  
● Step 2: The issuer then sends an amount, , of CLN to the market-making 

contract, thus establishing  

 
 

● Step 3: The issuer receives  of Token 2,  is the ​issuance price, ​and the 
total value of Token 2 in circulation (i.e., outside the reserve of the contract) in 
CLN terms is equal to 

  
● Step 4: The market-making contract opens to any Token 1 or Token 2 holders. 

 
Issuance with investors’ funds 
When issuing using this option, the issuer follows certain steps. 

● Step 1 is the same as in the first option. 
● Step 2: The issuer specifies the amount, ​I​1​, of CLN expected to be received (“hard 

cap”) and a fraction  of the amount (“soft cap”) designated to be locked in 
reserve for the purpose of market making and establishing an issuance price.  

● Step 3: The contracts test the validity of the  pair, verifying that if  of 
Token 1 are received, then the value of Token 2 in circulation (in CLN terms) is at 

least I​1​—that is, assuming that  of Token 1 are received, then

And the requirement is that 

  
 
Thus requiring that 

 

Note that the expression  is less than 0.5 for , and so  
satisfies it automatically. 
 

 
● If the contract passes the validity test, the contract opens to accepting CLN 

tokens from investors.  Tokens sent to the contract are locked in the reserve. 

● If less than  tokens are sent within the specified time, the contract returns the 
tokens to their holders and the contract shuts down (as funds received are below 
the “soft cap”). Any tokens in excess of I​1​ (“hard cap”) are not accepted by the 
contract. Assuming the amount of tokens sent is within the range , any 

tokens in excess of  are sent to the issuer. 
● Token 2 released from the reserve R​2​ are distributed to investors so that their 

value given the issuance price is equal to the value of the investment sent in CLN. 
The validity test ensures that there are enough Token 2 in circulation to satisfy
