Summary
WePower is a blockchain-based green energy trading platform. 

WePower comes to the market at a crucial time. Due to a drop in subsidies and increased re-
newable energy development competing at market price, banks started increasing demand for 
own capital decreasing debt to capital ratio. It moved from 20:80 to close to 50:50 ratio for

WePower enables renewable energy producers to raise capital by issuing their own energy to-
kens. These tokens represent energy they commit to produce and deliver. Energy tokenization 
standardizes simplifies and opens globally currently existing energy investment ecosystem. As 
a result energy producers can trade directly with the green energy buyers (consumers and in-
vestors) and raise capital by selling energy upfront, at below market rates. Energy tokenization 
ensures liquidity and extends access to capital. The WePower blockchain solution is currently 
recognized by Elering, one of the most innovative Transmission System Operators in Europe.

To optimize the financing cycle and open access to capital, WePower enables energy tokeniza-
tion. Tokenized energy represents a contracting mechanism between an energy producer and 
energy buyer.  

WPR token holders will have priority access to participate in auctions for purchasing tokenized 
energy once the renewable energy plant is connected to the platform.

Energy allocation will depend on the number of WPR tokens held by the participant. Moreover, 
WPR token holders are rewarded by no less than 0.9% of tokenized energy donated directly by 
the renewable energy providers through the WePower platform. WPR token holders may use 
or sell this energy.

The WePower platform is ready. You can try the demo version on our web page. We are working 
on the launch of our pilot project with a transmission system operator Elering. Current partner-
ships with the renewable energy producers allow WePower to be operational within 9 months 
after the main token sale. These partnerships will bring a pipeline of projects to be financed 
for the first 2 years of WePower operations. Having first clients in Spain and being accepted to 
Startupbootcamp Energy track in Australia, WePower simultaneously expands in two conti-
nents.

Our team is led by energy experts Nick Martyniuk, Kaspar Kaarlep and Heikki Kolk, who lead 
a group of 12 highly experienced energy engineers and former-Skype programmers. Our team 
of engineers has previously worked on the smart metering implementation countrywide in Es-
tonia, leader in the rollout of full smart grid in the world. Our Blockchain development is led by 
Jon Matonis (founding partner of Bitcoin Foundation), our token economy is structured with 
the help of Eyal Hertzog (chief product architect of the Bancor Protocol) and David Allen Cohen 
(smart grid innovator) helps with software matters.

The project is supported by the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania, due to its po-
tential social impact on climate change control. WePower will share part of its technologies to 
countries who implement green energy and CO2 accounting, using blockchain technologies.

The WePower innovative token model was clarified with the European regulator. It is structured 
as a reward based crowdfunding, where contributors are rewarded free energy which they may 
use or sell on the platform.

newly developing renewable energy projects. Equity capital became a limited source of financ-
ing contributing to a plunge (-23% YoY) in investment due to smaller leverages.

Energy tokenization together with a platform built on an open decentralized data-base, opens 
the green energy market globally to a broad pool of investors. In an open platform, new ener-
gy projects do not depend on only local investors., Asset liquidity allows more favorable capi-
tal-to-debt ratios without using Government subsidies. We estimate that the simplification of 
the investment process through WePower will significantly reduce financing costs, which is 
eventually split between renewable energy producers and consumers/investors.

1.Introduction

 1 Please see REN21 Report 2017 here: http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170607_GSR_2017_Full_Report.pdf (p110)

Investor’s side: Producer’s side:

• Lack of access to investments on local and
        global level

• Complicated and expensive investment 
process

• Limited transparency of investments

• Lack of capital needed to develop projects

• Long and excensive capital acquisition 
from banks and funds process perspective

• Constant lack of own funds

1.1. Current energy market structure

WePower was established to change how energy is developed and distributed. The WePower 
team has been in the market for several years during which time it became obvious that we are 
lagging behind renewable energy adoption. This is not for lack of a desire to live a cleaner life, 
and improve the world for future generations. It is due to current market bottlenecks, which 
slows development of renewable energy sources. There are too many intermediary players 
between renewable energy producers and consumers of energy. Ultimately, these costs go 
directly to consumers who  pay for it all.

Why not include customers to participate in the market directly to support a
green transition?

Current problems with the energy markets:

According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BENF1) , 2016 level of investment into renewable 
energy has reached a level of 242 Billion USD representing a 23% decrease over the previous 
year as seen in the chart on the right. Early 2017 trends show that investment in renewable en-
ergy has fallen 20,9% in Q1 compared to 2016 from 64,25 billion to  50,84 billion. The market 
is dominated by banks, PE funds, hedge funds that are keeping out everyone else from the en-
ergy investment market and not serving the needs of renewable energy community with proper 
access to capital nor the needs of end users of the energy.



8

WePower aims at cutting through the current problems of access to capital for the renewable 
energy producers and access to investments in great profitable projects directly for the final 
consumers. This is done using the fastest and transparent way through blockchain and energy 
tokenization. By employing technology WePower solves the following energy market insuffi-
ciencies:

• Global access to capital for green energy projects
• Global access to green energy investments and trading (i.e. liquidity)
• Speed and transparency

1.2. The WePower platform

WePower is a blockchain-based green energy trading platform. It connects energy buyers 
(households and investors or market makers) directly with the green energy producers and cre-
ates an opportunity to purchase energy upfront at below market rates. WePower uses energy 
tokenization to standardize, simplify and open globally the currently existing energy invest-
ment ecosystem.

Energy tokenization ensures liquidity and extends access to capital. Moreover, it provides the 
first access to live trade in renewable energy globally for everyone. With a possibility to be inte-
grated with IOT for purchase or exchange of energy as a base layer of the digital energy world, 
WePower will lead decentralized energy transformation.
 
Legally WePower acts as an independent energy supplier, allowing WePower platform to be 
connected to the energy grid and the local energy exchange market as well as energy end us-
ers. WePower receives data about the produced, consumed energy and energy price from the 
energy grid and energy exchange markets.



9

Once renewable energy producer is connected to WePower platform, his future energy pro-
duction is tokenized. Energy is tokenized based on kWh unit. One internal energy token rep-
resents 1 kWh to be produced a certain time in the future.

When a renewable energy producer requires capital to finance the initial cost of a renewable 
energy project, he may sell a portion of the energy to be produced in the future, on the WePow-
er platform. The buyer/investor acquires this energy in a form of internal energy tokens. Each 
energy token acts as a smart contract indicating: 1) type of energy, 2) time stamp when the 
energy will be produced and delivered; 3) price tag. This smart contract represents a standard 
power purchase agreement between the renewable energy producer and energy buyer.   

In addition to solving current issues in the development and financing of green energy projects, 
WePower also has the potential to become a next-generation utility company based on the 
core principles of decarbonization, democratization and decentralization. By combining the 
core technological stack elements which include blockchain, smart contracts, data analytics 
and machine learning, WePower is set to become a 21st century virtual utility working close-
ly with Distribution & Transmission system operators. This means that green energy projects 
without subsidies can finally take-off at a pace required to have a significant positive impact 
to the Earth’s dangerous experiment with climate change through data-based decentralized 
generation utility approach with the infrastructure security in mind required for this type of 
operations.

WePower as independent energy supplier operates under established regulation guaranteeing 
relationships with distribution system operators and transmission system operators as well as 
fair use of infrastructure. At the same time, WePower as the market participant is connected to 
wholesale energy markets to sell and buy energy when needed.

WePower development is divided in 3 distinct stages:

1. WePower Breeze - Market entrance - challenging the way how energy investments and pur-
chase are done today by creating necessary technological layer for the change to happen.  

2. WePower Storm - Growth of services and usability - aggregating and managing energy 
flows via smart contracts.

3. WePower Hurricane - New decentralized energy utility.

A detailed implementation road map is provided in Section 5.

2. WePower business case
We will begin with ecosystem creation in Europe, due to the unique regulatory framework 
there. The European energy community enjoys a competitive market, providing similar regu-
lation across all member states. This is the most important condition for energy tokenisation 
on the  scale necessary for energy tokenisation beyond borders. The grid cannot be bypassed. 
If there are no market conditions for open connection to the grid, p2p energy trading may be 
limited to microgrid solutions without scalability or may not be implemented at all. 



10

Core components of WePower growth are customer acquisition on energy production, ener-
gy consumption, and market liquidity. The platform will grow through  by providing greater 
transparency and simplicity to the market and delivering value unavailable today, due to mar-
ket inefficiencies. With focus on growth, it is paramount to create the best experience for the 
WePower platform user. The WePower team is engaging energy project developers in the field, 
developing market price based projects with a professional team to be expanded upon entering 
new markets.

Our sales teams work with high volume corporate and private energy consumers to provide 
them with outstanding service. We have secured our first clients in production who are devel-
oping renewable energy sources and generating more than 1000 MW solar energy capacity in 
Spain2. WePower continues working on increasing renewable energy project pipeline and more 
partnerships will be announced after the token sale.

Energy production is big business:

1. 24,756 TWh3 energy produced each year in total.
2. 24,756,000,000 MWh energy produced from renewable sources.
3. Assuming the LEC (levelized energy cost) from solar and wind averages 50 EUR/MWh (most 

likely less costly), total market of energy production alone and sales is 1.24 trillion USD.
4. Current yearly investments in renewable energy amount to 242 billion USD4.

In the future, this is estimated to reach a consumption of 100% renewable energy, with a rough 
estimation of the market size at 11.5 trillion USD and further replacement of existing renewable 
energy sources’ capacities, due to their natural life cycle. The market size is based on multiple 
investments that were required to reach the current renewable energy level of 24% (t.y. 2.3 
trillion USD) and the rest to reach a 100% renewable level. 

WePower targets both markets in terms of facilitation of investments into the renewable en-
ergy and trade of energy. WePower achieves this by facilitating a direct interaction between 
renewable energy producers and end users/investors globally. 

WePower as a platform will help renewable energy producers to attract capital directly from 
energy end users/investors. WePower will apply a commission fee to the amount of attracted 
capital. WePower enables trade of purchased energy. For each trade WePower will apply a 
commission fee as well. Projected profit of WePower is below (forward looking statement).

We expect to have over 3 times growth from our first to second year doubling the capacity 
connected to WePower in consecutive years. We will begin with the market we have a pres-
ence in through our current partners and expand from there. We expect investment from our 
partners and new resources online on the platform to be from 1000 - 2000 MW during 2018-
2019 in Spain, amounting to 2 billion EUR investments and 294 million EUR in energy trading. 
Renewable energy investment growth is at 15% annually. Looking at recent developments of 
WePower, the pipeline might be increased since WePower starts operations in Estonia and 
Australia simultaneously. With WePower’s ease of investment and trade of energy we expect 
exceptionally high platform growth.

Historical growth of investment was 15%  on average with fluctuations from year to year. By 
creating a way for everybody to buy energy at a more attractive price or to invest into new re-
newable projects, WePower has the potential to direct investors to renewable energy sources, 
bringing a 100% renewable future much closer.

WePower status:

Currently the team is focused on:

• Launching WePower pilot project with Elering and tokenizing all Estonian energy in April 
2018. We will issue 11 billion energy tokens and test our platform on the Estonian energy 
infrastructure.

The WePower platform allows renewable energy producers to tokenize and sell the energy they 
produce. A renewable energy producer connected to the platform issues its own energy tokens 
within the WePower platform, where 1 energy token represents 1 kWh of green energy to be

3. WePower token model
3.1. Energy tokenization



12

Each new renewable energy plant offers more economical energy to the users of the WePower 
platform through the auction mechanism, which sets the lowest price for energy per 1 kWh (or 
one energy token). The auction opens to WPR token holders first. WPR token holders will have 
48 hours advanced access.  After this period has elapsed, the remaining energy is offered to all 
WePower platform participants.

The lowest price offering is set by the auctioning party. Current and historical energy prices 
are visible on the platform. This gives market price reference for energy and acts as a reference 
ceiling for the maximum energy price.

3.2. Tokenized energy auction

produced in a certain time in the future (usually within 4-6 months from the connection mo-
ment).

Each renewable energy plant connected to the WePower platform will organize an auction for 
the sale of tokenized energy. WePower token holders will have priority access to such auctions 
and their allocation will depend on the number of WePower tokens they have. 

Each new plant will create an auction on the WePower platform for the sale of energy tokens to 
energy buyers with the minimum price set for each energy token, which will represent energy 
to be produced and delivered.

Through tokenization of renewable energy:

1. Renewable energy producers are able to pre-sell their production in a global market and 
acquire  necessary capital, increasing a project’s profitability.  

2. Investors gain better investment terms (lower costs and higher liquidity) as well as access 
to green energy projects across the globe in a standardised way. These developments make 
green energy an appealing asset class.

For example, a renewable energy producer is building 100 MW solar energy capacity plants
in Spain. The cost of such a project is estimated at 100 million EUR. The producer lacks 20
million USD to bring the project to life. Using WePower the producer tokenizes the projected
production of energy of 20 million USD and sells it up front. To incentivize buyers, the producer
is always selling its energy below market price which they can use for themselves or sell on the
marketplace.

3.3 Blockchain function

Relational databases are adequate in many applications and situations. However, sustainability 
and scalability are limited with these databases. From the perspective of sector transformation 
in trading and digital infrastructure creation, transforming energy production to 100% renew-
able, the answer was to utilize a public blockchain.

Blockchain allows:

• Innovative community interaction across applications



13

• Provide 3rd party liquidity through exchanges and decentralised exchange protocols
• Enhanced efficiency due to smart contract elimination of intermediaries 
• Enhanced security due to immutability of data
• Cheaper maintenance vs centralised database
• History of transactions and prediction of transactions
• Fault tolerance for DApps due to decentralised nature of blockchain

We are first building a platform to help finance renewable energy, and welcome everyone to 
join the platform in a trust-less way where people might not otherwise meet each other basing 
trust on pure math. With a vision to become independent from centralised authority we aim to 
develop the perfect platform for optimum value creation for all participants based on market 
conditions.

Energy is becoming decentralized in nature and the changing reality of it requires a decentral-
ized delivery system. For the short term, a relational database may suffice, but we are building 
a decentralized application for now and into the future where the energy grid will function 
and optimize itself, even under extreme conditions. Scalability beyond country borders is more 
important than short-term pragmatism, as scalability brings more value to the system. 100% 
renewable energy on the grid, with variable production, on a robust system is more important 
than a short-term solution. Our platform is scalable through blockchain technology beyond 
country borders or even continents to be a virtual utility of a new era in clean, decentralized 
world energy.

Every energy token represents 1 kWh of green energy to be produced by a certain time in the 
future. 

The owner of these energy tokens has the following options:
  
1. First - use the energy when it is produced, if the energy was purchased for a development 

project in the buyer’s home market.Note that WePower will physically deliver energy based 
on the number of energy tokens held, once WePower enters a token owner’s home market 
and begins operation under an independent energy supplier’s legal framework.

2. Second - sell the energy before its production within the WePower platform to any other 
user.

3. Third - automatically sell the energy to the wholesale energy market once the energy is pro-
duced and receive the energy price in fiat or crypto currency. This leaves an ambiguity of 
the final settlement price as it is done at the market price in that specific moment. However, 
it provides a safety net for the fund invested in energy. All energy with this option is sold 
simultaneously on the wholesale market.

3.4 Energy tokens use

If the token holder decides to choose the third option, he can i) cash out the proceeds imme-
diately or at a future date; or ii) reinvest the received amount in green energy and keep storing 
value via energy tokens. The value of this token will grow with the price of energy. However, it 
will never drop below its book value - the market cost of energy.



14

WePower has structured the WePower token sale to comply with applicable regulatory require-
ments. The token sale will be structured as a reward based crowdfunding campaign, where 
contributors in return for their donations will receive WePower tokens (WPR). If you would like 
to read our legal analysis, please see our legal overview. 

3.5.1. WPR - Real asset based token

Participants in the WePower token sale in return for their contributions receive WPR tokens. 
The WPR token will grant rights to:

1. Priority access to participate in tokenized energy sales. The WPR token acts as a priority 
access token for the auction to buy tokenized energy. WPR token holders will be first bid-
ding to acquire energy from each new plant joining the platform. After priority bidding, the 
remaining energy tokens are sold to any WePower user. Priority allocation for energy token 
auction is proportional to the amount of WPR the holder has.

2. Receive part of a renewable energy producer’s tokenized energy. Under the WePower 
platform’s terms & conditions, each renewable energy producer will be required to donate 
0.9% of all tokenized energy to the WPR token holders. However, WePower is not liable if 
renewable energy provider fails to implement its obligation to donate energy. Each WPR 
token holder receives tokenized energy proportionally.

Once the renewable energy producer connects to WePower platform, WPR token holders re-
ceive tokenized energy (i.e. energy tokens). WPR token holder’s rights are indefinite. This guar-
antees WPR token holders receive green energy from each producer tokenizing energy and

using the WePower platform. 

A WPR token holder can choose what to do with the received tokenized energy (i.e. received 
energy tokens) as indicated above:

1. Use.
2. Sell before its production. 
3. Sell to the wholesale market when it is produced and reinvest.

3.5.2. Underlying WPR value

The table below shows intended WePower expansion. Calculations are based on our contract-
ed clients in Spain and Italy, which will connect 1000 MW capacity solar energy farms. These 
initial clients will tokenize at least 20% of their production.

The above table is considered to be a forward looking statement. WePower has calculated pro-
jections based on its first partnerships and market potential. However, this does not guarantee 
that WePower will have the projected project pipeline.  

With each connected energy provider,  a portion of the energy will be donated to WPR token 
holders at the time of tokenisation as is described in Donation Of Energy 0.9% in kWh. This en-
ergy may be retrieved proportionally to the amount of WPR tokens held and either consumed 
or sold in the marketplace. Tokens not distributed during the token sale will be locked up and 
unable to retrieve energy. The lockup will last 3-4 years. Therefore, locked tokens might partic-
ipate in the energy donation pool only after year 3-4.

3.6. WPR - The next generation token

WePower is the next stage in token economy evolution. The great majority of tokens currently 
released in the market, tokenize equity or company future cash flows, both of which do not 
have an existing intrinsic value. WePower tokenizes energy, which has a well established mar-
ket and measurable value.

7  This whitepaper will not address the problems of climate change. However, we will provide links to materials that show why taking care of the planet and switching to              
clean energy is more important than ever before. Moreover, we will explain what is the cost of dirty energy on our life to be paid by us or our children.

The energy market today is dominated - 78,4%6 of the total energy supply -by dirty energy,, 
despite the transition begun many years ago since theories regarding global climate change 
have appeared7. This process has accelerated in the last decade with oil prices reaching record 
highs in 2008 and a push towards the search for alternatives. Many developed countries with 
the support of government during the Kyoto protocol have established renewable energy sup-
port programs with variable success to achieve protocol defined goals.

Transforming an energy market in development for over  100 years to run on clean energy is a 
difficult task, requiring great amounts of capital. Investment thus far, have enabled a renew-
able energy level of 21.6%. Moving towards a decentralized future, this market must appeal to 
investors.. Most P2P energy platforms struggle to scale globally, since  significant transaction 
volumes are first necessary to enable P2P energy trading.

Capital availability today is the most important issue for any project developer. On different lev-
els, this is dominated by banks, funds, etc., where the goal is always to maximize their share of 
profits. These high profit percentage requirement slows developers by minimising their returns 
and their ability to reinvest income in new renewable projects. Debt providers (banks) are not 
usually open to projects without a substantial amount of equity capital already raised. Natu-
rally, current investment consideration becomes a very difficult and lengthy process, requiring 
from 3 to 6 months to conclude an agreement. In addition is the time a developer spends locat-
ing and researching investors.

5.1.1. Challenge: limited and expensive capital for green energy project developers

5.1. WePower - Breeze

Blockchain and token sale partners:

• BlockchainIL - the leading ICO advisory firm with over 6 years of experience in the Block-
chain industry and numerous successful projects completed such as Bancor (US$ 153M); 
Sirin Labs (US$ 157M); Stox (US$ 33M) and more.

• AmaZix - community management for crypto projects

• 220 Energia is an electricity retailer operating across a number of countries in the Nordic 
and Baltic region.



26

With the increasing percentage required of initial capital for renewable energy development 
projects (highlighted in a recent BNEF8 article) renewable energy production capital availability 
becomes an even  more important issue as banks increase the demand on higher initial capital/
debt ratio from 20:80 to close to 50:50 for new developing projects. This makes equity a very 
expensive source of finance, due to limited availability and increased requirement of such. 
77%9 of the financing in previous years was done through Project financing. Changing debt 
structure will have a significant impact on the available debt and thus total investment in the 
market.

The second problem linked to the changing financing structure of energy production at the 
market price is the participation of individuals in the market. For example, a number of peers 
participating in the energy market investments are negligible. High net worth individuals 
(HNWI) make up the majority of investors in infrastructure projects such as renewable energy 
production through Private Equity funds. The general public is faced with these barriers to 
enter the market and invest:

1. Minimum investment amount - at least 125,000 EUR
2. Long capital lock-up times - 10 years for a typical fund
3. Lack of knowledge of fund manager reputations and trust in their team 

WePower’s first objective is to address this capital availability problem along with the current 
complexity of administrative issues. By reaching this goal, WePower will increase the renew-
able energy production growth and the growth of green energy users. Such growth would 
allow WePower to move towards P2P energy trading and final consumer participation in the 
market, a necessity in  coping with global warming.

5.1.2. Current working model – attracting capital

The conventional investment process is lengthy and inefficient. In order to acquire financ-
ing, the renewable energy producer must:

1. Analyze the site of energy production compared to other sites
2. Analyze regulations to bring the project online and risks of completion
3. Analyze and selecting equipment to suit the business case
4. Analyze and selecting a construction company with experience and acceptable business 

practices
5. Analyze other risks that may come from development of the project

The above list may vary depending on the specifics of each project development but it is a 
necessary process and cannot be rushed. The next step for a developer is to search for the 
financing of the project. Raising capital is a gamble. Every investor and/or bank must:

1. Check if risks are acceptable for the investor considering its return
2. Compare the investment and its return with other investment opportunities with similar 

return and risk ratio

These projects go through technical, legal and financial due diligence. This is not a standard-
ized process and varies from investor to investor and bank to bank.

Investment flow chart with intermediaries:

WePower simplifies the capital raising process to unlock value currently untapped, by con-
necting renewable energy producers with the global financial markets and every user of the 
internet the.

5.1.3. Investment process simplified

Each new project aims to begin as quickly as possible. However, this is not an easy task. Capital 
availability is the number one issue delaying most projects. A large part of this is administra-
tive, negotiating the acceptable risks of a project, cost of risks and their coverage, lack of initial 
equity capital etc.

WePower provides a marketplace to sell green energy utilizing  smart contracts for each token 
kWh to be delivered at a specific time. This simple model allows projects to raise capital faster 
with the obligation to deliver green energy at the prearranged price. Even the onboarding pro-
cess is simple and standard.

WePower has already created a functional, basic energy trading network, which connects ener-
gy producers and buyers, market makers and/or investors. With our existing product, WePower 
helps renewable energy project developers attract capital in an efficient way, which in turn 
significantly increases the project’s return on equity (ROE) ratio. Simultaneously, the platform 
provides access for any individual to invest in the energy market, without going through a pain-
ful administrative process, due diligence or high entry costs and barriers. Moreover, WePower 
cuts energy costs for consumers and generates stable, high and asset-backed returns.

5.1.4. Standardization of kWh token issue

From the administrative responsibilities listed above, with WePower the producer has only 
two tasks:

1. Accept standard rules of the smart contract (i.e.,  power purchase agreement)
2. Negotiate discount from the market price for the energy to be produced in the future or 

simply the price of green energy at which the community is willing to buy energy to make 
profit acceptable to both parties

WePower not only provides a simplified process, but also increases a project’s ROE up to 20%. 
Below is a simplified example of the business case of attracting capital through internal energy 
token sale on the WePower platform. In other words, capital requirements are met by selling 
energy to be produced in the future in a form of energy tokens with a discount, compared to 
the current market price.

With Token sale: Without Token sale:

a. Equality need 29% a. Equality need 40%

b. Tokens Sold 11% of project b. Tokens Sold 0%

c. Debt 60% c. Debt 60%

d. ROE 20% d. ROE 16%

As capital is received prior to construction, the price of electricity to be delivered is set (hedg-
ing future sales of energy depending on the amount of tokens or energy sold). This decreases 
the need of initial capital needed for construction. Once the delivery of energy according to the 
concluded initial smart contract is complete, the producer sells the rest of produced energy at 
market price. This way, a producer gets the full benefit of plant energy sales, sharing the ben-
efits of lower energy price with consumers and taking advantage of higher future income flow 
on less capital initially invested.
 
This example shows in general terms why it makes sense issuing tokens from the renewable en-
ergy producer’s perspective. The WePower model has already attracted its first clients, which 
will connect approx. 1,000 MW capacity solar plants in Spain to the platform in order to fi-
nance their construction.

5.1.5. Speed of investment

5.2. Challenge: lack of access to green energy investment
opportunities.

5.2.1. Local & global investments

Not every country is the same; some are blessed with sunshine, others with wind and others 
with powerful rivers or other hydro resources. However, investments should be done where 
they would bring most impact producing energy at market price and without subsidies, which 
pose the risk of Governments changing positions on subsidies or sometimes implementing ex-
treme changes such as with President Trump’s view on energy and climate change.

WePower intends to provide global access to development projects that produce energy at the 
market price and would allow more people to benefit. Why invest in solar energy where there 
is not much sunshine? Invest where the sun shines year round and buy locally available green 
energy from the proceeds of your investment. Here is an example:

12 You can think of the internal rate of return as the interest percentage that company has to achieve in order to break even on its investment in new capital.
13 IRR calculation using a reverse formula to find IRR.

With simple standardized terms of smart contracts running on the blockchain, without required 
trust in middlemen and with global access to investments, the WePower solution provides ev-
eryone with a fast, secure and cheap access to a green energy future.

This realization has come with the growth of blockchain use. The disruption of financing has 
begun with further development of transaction scalability11. With clear and standardized rules, 
projects are able to begin in a matter of hours once showing their capacity to execute. The pro-
cess will streamline further with the development of the necessary tools to make the process 
as smooth as possible. Reducing the time from consideration and negotiations to investment 
from 3 months on average (taking into account all negotiations with funds and banks when the 
project is ready for investment) to a few clicks after reviewing terms and understanding return 
via the discount on green energy provided by the project developer.

Many governments have previously supported renewable energy development to some extent, 
however, some countries have much more renewable energy potential without any subsidies. 
Let us compare UK and Spain using IRR12:

Government support through subsidies would give a larger return on such a project in the UK. 
However, after the support period has ended14 project earnings drop significantly, creating dis-
tortion of the market and hindering the development of  potentially better renewable energy 
options and wasting tax revenues allocated to subsidies..

We begin with countries that have an abundance of renewable resources to be developed at 
market price and in operation for many decades, not only while receiving subsidies. For exam-
ple: Spain, Italy, Greece and France, beginning with countries that have high solar irradiation, 
wind or hydro resources and are capable of producing renewable energy at market price.

5.2.2. Gains from investment process simplified

We want to make the process of attracting capital more efficient. The evaluation process for 
investment becomes much simpler when investing in something you are used to everyday with-
out complicated financial terms. Your consideration of investing is limited to 2 things:

1. Amount of energy or investment size
2. Energy price or discount applicable to the current market price for energy

14 Please see here: https://www.canadiansolar.com/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/datasheets/en/new/Flyer_KuDymond_CS3U-MS-FG_EN.pdf - at least 30-year useful 
life.

The WePower role of attracting capital from anyone wishing to invest in the energy market 
becomes extremely important due to the following reasons:

1. Scarcity of funds present on the market to develop renewable projects
2. Changes in project debt structure requiring higher equity portions
3. End of subsidies for renewable energy

Based on the the WePower model, users of the platform would invest in green energy which is 
a tradable resource within the WePower platform and on any national market of the country of 
the project origin. Energy can be traded between countries where energy import and export 
is technically possible. This makes math for understanding investment returns very simple. As 
mentioned above, the renewable energy producer, in order to raise the necessary equity capital 
for project development, sells part of its energy to be produced in the future. This energy is 
always sold below the average market price. The discount for this energy price will depend on 
the market demand/ supply in the WePower platform. The following shows a simple investment 
return example:

1. Cost of energy token (kWh) versus market price in a specific country:

    0,039 Eur/kWh - token price  (T)
    0,047 Eur/kWh - market price (M)

2. Difference between prices and return:

When we add time consideration we can see the followings

With the proportional portfolio holding of energy for all 4 years the IRR would be on average 
10.4%. This is a fixed proportions example. However, different portfolio proportions are also 
possible in order to satisfy the business model of the plant selling tokenized energy. This would 
change the example accordingly - different proportions of tokens sold in different years change 
the return on the initial investment. Just as an example, current return on Government bonds 
in many countries in the developed world would return close to 0% or in some cases negative 
return such as in bonds of Germany15 or Switzerland16.   

Complicated project risk considerations are the responsibility of the developer. These risks are 
included in the price of energy production, simplifying the buyer’s/investor’s decision to buy 
the final product which price is determined by the market with a substantial discount. Project 
due diligence is done by the experienced WePower team.

The user of the platform who has acquired token for the energy to be produced in the future 
may:

1. Sell to another user until the moment the energy is produced
2. Automatically sell in the national energy market where the energy is produced and receive 

proceeds
3. Use for energy needs if WePower is working as an independent energy supplier in the buy-

er’s  market. When the user decides to use the energy, he does not need to pay for the 
acquired energy and saves the difference between the price he paid and the market price 
when the energy was produced.

Moreover, energy has tangible value and its demand is increasing yearly with greater con-
nectivity of electrical devices, electric cars even with an increased energy efficiency of new 
devices.

5.2.3. Efficient use of capital

We understand that capital needs to be invested efficiently, thus in projects able to produce 
renewable energy cheaply, users will be able to:

1. Compare projects through the cost of tokens
2. Compare markets through energy tokens and returns on investments



32

5.2.4. Clear and transparent investment structure

Transparency is one of the main features of public blockchain that eliminates the need for trust. 
All contracts, due to their transparent nature and presence on a public blockchain (in our case 
the Ethereum blockchain) make the investment structure clear. All conditions of the power 
purchase agreement, which will work as a smart contract, can be easily verifiable. As no com-
plicated risk considerations are included in unsubsidized renewable energy projects, the only 
variable left will be the energy price.

5.2.5. Energy market status and liquidity beyond the platform

Markets are becoming more and more unified and are applying the same rules to its partic-
ipants. Legal overview on the current legal system of energy markets will be provided in the 
additional reading materials we will publish in Medium. With the current level of independent 
energy production and market competition, over 80% of electricity transactions are done over 
exchange, making markets mature and highly liquid.

Exchange market participation:

OTC Market participation:

The investment in energy will be used as efficiently as possible for the highest return for the 
backers of such projects while still making a profit for renewable energy projects themselves. 

WePower integrated with local energy market exchanges as a participant, is able to sell energy 
at a time when there is less liquidity on the platform. WePower also gives access to the public 
to be directly connected to the markets globally through WePower, thereby  always having 
liquidity at market price.

5.2.6. Shift

WePower proposes to receive returns from energy where investment is profitable, sustainable 
and efficient and use earnings in the local market to procure green energy. WePower, Acting 
as an independent energy supplier would take care of supplying platform customers with the 
cross-border transfer of energy when economically viable, or local green energy by swapping 
energy tokens according to the preference of source and availability.

The customer/investor would always have a choice whether to get proceeds from the sale of 
energy in the market or to opt for the supply of green energy and swap the token in a country 
where it is more efficient to produce from a specific source to the supply of green energy in his 
home country, as seen above in a form of domestic country token.

5.2.7. Secondary trade

While bringing standardization to energy production  and tokenizing energy with the help of 
blockchain and smart contracts, WePower will enable trade and liquidity in green energy. The 
current market, due to a shift from subsidized to unsubsidized energy production, has pushed 
project developers to PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) providers who cut the discount on 
energy from the producer so they are able to show some fixed income and stability to the bank 
instead of accepting the full market price and volatility.

Current PPA market varies from country to country, however with the increasing scale of mar-
ket price the gap is wide. As an example, current offers of PPA on the market are in a range of 
39 EUR per MWh for solar energy and 37 EUR/MWh for wind with the average market price 
of energy of 47 EUR for the past 10 years17. It creates opportunities to realize sizable profits 
for the PPA providers. With WePower we will provide this opportunity for anyone without any 
additional barriers to trade.

5.3. Challenge: incentives, trust and transparency 
 
WePower transforms the way green energy is accounted for. The platform does so by provid-
ing a technologically more efficient, transparent and robust solution, making use of a public 
blockchain ledger and smart contracts. The current green energy certificate market lacks 
integration, trust and transparency as well as efficiency. Furthermore, it does not incentivize 
further green energy generation capacity investments.

5.3.1. The current green energy certificate market

Currently, green energy certificates operate as guarantees of the origin of electricity produc-
tion and are accounted for by different entities assigned to do so in each country. In the Euro-
pean Union, the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) are typically responsible for this task. 
In principle, green energy certificates are derivate energy products and can be purchased



34

18 The period for issuance of the permit varies from 2 weeks to 2 months.
19 This ledger can be as simple as a Microsoft Excel file, which is prone to tampering, errors and exhibits a low-level of security.

1. Does not support further green energy production: current producers and traders of 
green energy certificates have no formal obligation to invest the proceeds of sales of the 
green energy certificates into further green energy generation capacity. Furthermore, as 
there is no information about the geographical location of the green energy, these two 
aspects combined means that there is no mechanism to use the green energy certificates 
to further speed up the transition towards renewable energy. There is no effective mecha-
nism to support local green energy production.

2. Transparency indicating whether green energy is subsidized or not: In the European 
Union, it is up to national policymakers to decide if subsidized green energy production 
can receive green energy certifications or whether they can be applied only for non-subsi-
dized energy. As a result, in some countries subsidized green energy production receives 
green certificates but not in others. This lack of transparency distorts the market and may 
miss-align incentives for further investment in green energy generation. A wider EU solu-
tion to harmonize disclosure and transparency is required. And while national solutions 
can be reliable, integration of the current national disclosure systems would be very cost-
ly.

3. Lack of transparency and disclosure for consumers: Although disclosure might appear 
to consumers as an abstract and complicated topic, it is important that they know they 
can trust the system information. How the system works must be made accessible for 
consumers demanding this information. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware that 
by buying electricity based on renewables, they cannot be guaranteed they will physically 
consume electricity produced by renewable sources (as mentioned above - green energy 
certificates are derivative products). It only ensures that the same amount of electricity 
(which is consumed) has been generated by renewables somewhere in the electricity mar-
ket.

4. Lack of details in accounting green energy: The data concerning guarantees of origin is 
managed by different local institutions in each country on a private ledger19. Green energy 
certificate production may or may not match the green energy certificate consumption 
in each country. In such a case, the inter-country balancing is done via cooperation of the 
local institutions and regional energy exchanges by adequately adjusting the ledgers for 
such data for each country. However, there is no single standard and source of informa-
tion, therefore it is difficult for the customers to know and trust the exact source of the 
green electricity they consume.

separately and/or together with physically consumed energy.

Green certificates are usually obtained on a monthly basis18, if the following conditions
are met:

1. The energy producer operates in the renewable energy market
2. Any subsidies must be declared on the certificate (otherwise the certificate might not be 

tradable as it is seen that support is granted by means of subsidies)
3. Issue of certificate is based on the principle 1 MWh – 1 certificate

There are a number of issues with the current way green energy certificates are managed:



35

5. Fragmented implementation of green energy certificates: the implementation of the 
guarantee of origin system has primarily had a national focus in most countries. Custom-
ers would benefit insofar as the costs of the traded guarantee of origin would be made 
transparent and guarantee of origin trading could be more cost-efficient. Both energy 
consumers and regulators have expressed a need to introduce platforms capable of mak-
ing inter-market trading of guarantees of origin more transparent, secure and non-dis-
criminatory through harmonization20.

6. Barriers to entry for smaller residential users: currently, one guarantee of origin equals 
1 MWh which is more than the typical monthly consumption of a residential user. Further 
more, certificates are usually purchased for a period of 12 months (equaling theirmaximum 
longevity). This means that residential users are forced to predict their consumption and 
round it up to the next MW, meaning they risk overpaying for energy if they seek a 100% 
green energy consumption.

5.3.2. Renewable energy and green certificate trading transformation

Clear, transparent and trustworthy electricity production disclosure, i.e. green energy certifi-
cates, are essential if a voluntary, consumer-driven market for renewables is to be created. Fur-
thermore, green energy certificates are a fundamental tool for supporting consumer awareness 
and choice in a power market. The energy market requires further integration of the different 
disclosure systems in a more efficient and reliable way at an international level. This is exactly 
what the WePower platform delivers - an efficient, affordable and harmonized solution which 
has the potential to be established as a best practice in the industry. 
 
Green energy certificates are a tradable commodity21 and such trade will be carried out by us-
ing the WePower platform. Current regulations mean that energy suppliers (including WePow-
er) can facilitate the trade of energy on a voluntary basis without any statutory restrictions. 
WePower takes care of all the administrative work for the energy producer to obtain green 
certificates. In cases when small energy producers using WePower services cannot reach 1 
MWh – 1 certificate limit, these small energy producers are pooled together and share the 
benefit proportionally, meaning that barriers to entry are removed for smaller residential users. 

By combining existing technologies, WePower fundamentally transforms the way green en-
ergy is accounted for and provides an advanced, robust as well as trustworthy solution to the 
current green energy certification market. With WePower, residential energy consumers and 
businesses can:

1. Purchase green energy and have automated and verifiable proof of the amount of green 
energy purchased via the information stored on the blockchain.

2. Purchase green energy more efficiently as both the energy and method to guarantee its 
green origin is the same product, instead of procuring energy and green certificates as two 
separate products.

3. Ensure that the purchase of green energy products actually promotes the development of 
green energy products by effectively purchasing future green energy, unlike now, where 
there is no legal obligation or technical way to ensure that revenue for green certificates is 
spent on promoting more green energy.

4. Ensure that local generation is supported, as it becomes possible to track the exact

geographical origin of each green energy MWh produced. For example, it becomes possi-
ble to pay additional premiums for green energy if it is generated locally, to promote further 
local green energy generation capacity.

5. Receive all information about the mix of green energy (e.g. solar, wind, hydro) certificates 
purchased, the location of the production, and whether the production is subsidized.

5.3.3. Alignment of the incentives for trust and transparency

Green energy supply and trading on the WePower platform acts as an advanced version of the 
existing guarantee of origin of electricity production certificates which are currently often diffi-
cult to understand for customers. With a coherent, reliable and trustworthy solution, WePower 
solves multiple challenges relating to the fragmentation of green energy markets. Therefore, 
WePower is supported by local governments and regulators (please see the document from 
the Lithuanian Ministry of Energy)22 as it not only addresses the cost-efficiency and trust chal-
lenges, but also aligns the incentives of the green energy producers and consumers wishing to 
support and participate in further development of green generation assets.

5.4 WePower Development stages

The WePower platform connects Ethereum smart contracts based global trading and invest-
ment capabilities to local renewable green energy plant construction, energy retail and flexi-
bility markets. 

The roadmap to realizing these features is divided into 3 general stages of expanding complex-
ity, called Breeze, Storm and Hurricane. All three phases completed will form the technology 
stack for a next generation virtual utility company., one that encompasses all technological 
and process capabilities of a traditional vertically integrated utility, but is purpose-built for 
the emerging decentralized, democratized and decarbonized world. In essence this means al-
though it is basically a utility company, its system nodes are connected virtually, through infor-
mation flows, instead of physically through energy flows. Hence a virtual utility company does 
not own assets, but can provide all the trading, control and asset management capabilities for 
these assets. The physical layer still runs on traditional power grid operators - and the virtual 
utility will operate within current regulatory and business frameworks. It does not require reg-
ulatory change, although success on different markets will be somewhat driven by regulation. 

More detailed information and background about the engineering challenges to be tackled



37

are in the paragraphs below. The 3 general stages represent a lifecycle. Breeze corresponds to 
demonstrating all core features on a full value chain - hence a properly piloted system. Storm 
demonstrates features required for larger concentrations of renewable energy where electric-
ity transmission and distribution grid limitations and flexibility become an issue to manage 
- hence Storm will demonstrate the ability of the WePower platform to successfully tackle the 
problems of grid integration. Hurricane will then take the system with all features tested and 
focus on standardization, optimization and simplification - hence, in Hurricane, development 
focuses on making the platform even easier and cheaper to use, as the platform is being scaled 
on target markets. 

Although the roadmap does not cover the internals of engineering management, they will be 
mentioned here in a few words. The 3 lifecycle phases have corresponding engineering orga-
nization expansions. Team size will expand only as the features of one stage have been suffi-
ciently validated, so as to keep the overall engineering running cost optimal, while avoiding 
productivity and team culture problems associated with rapid expansion. The team for Breeze 
is ready and a recruitment and expansion strategy has been laid out. For more information on 
key team members check chapter 4 - execution and business.

5.4.1. WePower Breeze - investment, trade, consumption of energy & Smart contracts

The objective of the Breeze phase of engineering is to integrate the WPR token and the En-
ergy token with a global trading platform connected to regional wholesale and local energy 
retail markets with the capability to aggregate renewable energy plants.

Breeze is concluded when a user can invest in certified renewable green energy and cash out 
whenever he or she desires. 

To invest in green energy, the high level flow is as follows. When a plant is first planned, we will 
estimate its energy production pattern. Then the green energy developer will be able to bun-
dle up the desired amount of future-generated power and set a price for it. The platform then 
converts this into Ethereum smart contracts that will be called Energy tokens on the WePower 
platform. These tokens are then offered for sale on the platform. Tools to view and evaluate 
green energy projects under development and to find suitable opportunities to invest will be 
developed by our team.

In principle, three options exist to sell energy - wholesale markets, retail markets and plat-
form-internal trade. Internal trading features will be developed first. Of the wholesale mar-
kets, integrations, both technical and organizational, will be developed initially with Nordpool, 
EPEXSPOT and OMIE, covering most of Europe.Other market integrations will be added later. 
Each wholesale market will vary slightly with its rules, so at this stage the user will have to 
choose the target market. For retail markets, local rules will apply and consumption or retail 
selling will be available at markets where WePower registers as an energy retail company. Mar-
kets with Smart Meters are preferred as accurate metering is the basis for capturing value from 
price fluctuations. 

To make the trading operations across this complex landscape easy and usable, a wallet system 
will be developed, allowing for easy transferring and redemption of energy tokens between 
different retail and wholesale markets. This wallet will also link to the WPR utility token and

5.4.2. WePower Storm - enabling high penetration of renewable energy

Aggregating and managing energy flows to enable high penetrations of green renewable ener-
gy and to add the flexibility trading dimension

In WePower Storm, as more plants and consumers connect to the platform, additional opti-
mization capabilities are developed for prosumers (producers and/or consumers) and local 
power grids in order to fit more green renewable energy into the grid and onto the platform.

This phase is critical to ensure that WePower solves the green energy challenge at every level. 
Since this deals with power grid integrations, it is also the most complex phase. A basic under-
standing of green renewable energy impact on the physical grid layer is required to understand 
what kind of optimization is being developed in Storm.

5.4.3 The impact of green energy investments on electricity grids

Electricity use can vary dramatically on short and medium time frames, depending on the time of 
the year, people movement, weather patterns and other difficult to predict events. Electricity gen-
eration adjusts to changing demand by dispatching additional or producing fewer sources based 
on the efficiency and cost. Optimization of energy generation in order to satisfy energy demand 
at each moment of time is the classic role of the transmission system operator (TSO). The supply 
of that energy to each and every consumer is the role of the distribution system operator (DSO).  

Current electricity grids are designed around centralized large generation units that are using 
steam, heated by various fuels, to spin large rotating turbines at a stable speed of 50Hz. Green 
energy investments by their nature are not centrally connected to the grid at a single point, but 
represent distributed electricity generation that has varying, not stable, energy supply profiles. 

Since this deals with power grid integrations, it is also the most complex phase. A basic under-
standing of green renewable energy impact on the physical grid layer is required to understand 
what kind of optimization is being developed in Storm.

5.4.4. Grid of today challenges

Electricity grids are not designed, planned or operated to take full advantage of distributed 
green energy resources.

The impact of varying load on the energy infrastructure planning and operations carries a sig-
nificant cost for society that is paid by all consumers as a regulated grid fee component on their

allow to gather the free Energy token donations that accrue on that over time. The tokens will 
function as certificates and the user will always know where the green energy comes from.

In order to coordinate distributed green energy production into a wholesale market-capable of-
fer, aggregation capabilities are integrated and tested, according to the requirement on whole-
sale markets to offer bundled energy. The current concept assumes the aggregation/flexibility 
module will be sourced and integrated, not internally developed.



39

5.4.5. WePower Storm: Future of the grid

Future - Integration to the electric grid and distributed green energy, enabling high levels of 
renewables in the grid for minimal investment.

In WePower Storm a fully transparent and decentralized ownership model for green energy 
projects will be implemented.  The integration with energy production plants will be expanded 
beyond metering data to include control and monitoring systems. This will allow for advanced 
asset performance analytics capabilities and machine learning techniques for optimization to 
be integrated. The resulting visualizations of asset performance and flow modeling will allow 
the investment data analytics tools on the platform to better reflect the locational and asset 
flexibility value for the electric grid infrastructure. Another layer of value for distributed green 
energy resources is added to the platform and it provides superior investment decision support 
for platform traders. 
 
Virtual Power Plant control system capabilities will be integrated into the platform and direct 
integration into flexibility market platforms will be developed in regions where renewable pen-
etration rates are high enough to support this. In the following figure you can see the recent 
developments of explicit demand response in Europe today23.

energy bills. Grid investments, including the integration of distributed green energy resources, 
are still planned based on static suboptimal principles. 

Electricity networks are planned and designed on the basis of meeting the local peak demand 
or peak generation. Such a peak might only occur for a few hours on a handful of days in a year. 
When a new prosumer applies to connect with the grid, system operators assess whether the 
generation and/or consumption capacity requested could breach consumption and/or genera-
tion limits at this peak time.

In many cases, the new applicant can indeed cause a possible breach. If this risk is identified, 
then under the current application management principles, regardless of the magnitude and/or 
likelihood of the possible breach, this will prompt grid reinforcements. The cost of implement-
ing such reinforcements will, depending on the regulation, either be covered by the applicant, 
or by the network, which means the costs will be spread among all consumers equally. 

To overcome this suboptimal nature of connecting dynamic supply to a statically designed 
grid, many TSO-s and DSO-s have implemented flexibility trading platforms. With the flexi-
bility mechanism, it becomes possible to enable new green energy to connect to the network 
without implementing grid reinforcements. The latter is true if the prosumer agrees to be con-
strained when the network reaches its capacity limits. This can reduce the costs of connecting 
to the network and also the time to connect, as reinforcement work is not required.

With larger concentrations of distributed renewable resources such power quality problems as 
voltage level fluctuations, increase of total harmonic distortion, or other complex issues may 
also need to be taken into account while planning.

Aggregators, flexibility service providers, and the flexibility market

An aggregator is an entity which offers services to aggregate energy production, storage or 
consumption from different sources and acts in the market as one entity. 

One form of aggregated entity is  a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). VPP is a cluster of distributed 
generation installations (such as solar, micro CHP, wind-turbines, small hydro, backup conven-
tional generators etc.) which are collectively run by a central control entity. A VPP is created 
either for the purpose of energy trading optimization or the provision of the flexibility support 
services for the system, such as balancing reserves, congestion management, and frequency 
regulation. 
 
A flexibility service provider (FSP) is an individual or aggregated market participant with the 
capacity to change electricity usage or a generation of prosumers (their normal or current con-
sumption/production patterns) in response to flexibility offer activation signals. FSP provides 
flexibility services to the flexibility markets.

The flexibility market process includes 3 main process steps: inquiry, bidding and clearing. 
  
Inquiry process is designed to send signals from grid operators towards FSP-s to notify them of 
the need for flexibility somewhere in the grid. After the trading starts, the information collec-
tion from FSP-s is performed, receiving and registering flexibility offers for the operator. Then,

Frequency management is of critical importance in the electricity system. The primary objec-
tive for a TSO in balance management is to maintain the power system frequency, which de-
scribes the balance between electricity production and consumption. In a normal situation, the 
frequency is permitted to vary between 49.9 and 50.1 Hz. If the frequency of the grid is below 
50 Hz, consumption exceeds production. Correspondingly, when the frequency is above 50 
Hz, production is greater than consumption.

The power balance is maintained by means of frequency-controlled reserves and manual regu-
lations. The frequency-controlled reserve consists of power which is activated automatically by 
frequency changes. If it is not possible to keep the frequency within the permitted limits using 
frequency-controlled reserves alone, manual upregulation or down-regulation is carried out.

With the growth of generation in the distribution networks and the empowerment of consum-
ers through markets and technology, distribution grid users constitute a substantial source of 
flexibility that can benefit the power system, both at a local and systemic scale. 

Congestion in a power system occurs when the transmission lines are not sufficient to transfer 
the power according to the market desires. Thus, congestion management is a tool for

the prices are negotiated by means of an auction. After gate-closure, the bids can be chosen 
for activation. 

Flexibility bids are registered in a common system to guarantee the transparency of the bidding 
and purchasing processes. All purchases placed by the TSO and the DSOs are registered. The 
information is processed and then provided to all market participants.

The purchasing market participants place their purchasing bids according to these continu-
ously updated lists. This provides indirect communication between the market participants. 
In case of conflict, bids can be blocked. The clearing process is performed after the flexibility 
activations to support the billing and payment settlement flow.

WePower Storm: enabling smart contract powered flexibility services

Congestion management and frequency regulation services, supported by machine learning 
and AI techniques, will be sold on the flexibility markets - both “slow” and “quick” activation 
will be supported.

• “Slow” load activation (max within 15 minutes). Increase and/or decrease distributed 
power consumption and/or generation at a predefined magnitude within a predefined geo-
graphical area by activating bids from FSPs. “Slow” load activation will be used for Business 
use-cases where the grid requirements enable a reaction time within 15 minutes. Such mea-
sures are mostly designed to preempt grid constraints.

• “Quick” load activation (max within 5 seconds). Increase and/or decrease distributed 
power consumption and/or generation at a predefined magnitude within a predefined geo-
graphical area by activating bids from FSPs. “Quick” load activation will be used for busi-
ness use-cases where the grid requirements assume a near-real-time reaction time (e.g. for 
the primary frequency reserve).

efficiently making use of the power available without violating the system constraints. Conges-
tion management refers to avoiding or relieving congestion.

5.4.6. WePower Hurricane: decentralized virtual energy utility

As core and auxiliary platform features are successfully developed, WePower Hurricane 
will focus on drastically improving the scalability of the platform through lowering of trans-
action costs, simplification and automation of user interface, and introducing AI powered 
system-wide optimization.

WePower Hurricane focuses on improving the user experience and platform connectivity op-
tions and in fully realizing two wepower complex system concepts - the decentralized virtual 
energy utility and the peer-to-peer energy marketplace. 

User experience is critical because the utility business has a very wide customer range and in 
order to build user experiences that are simple and understandable across a wide demographic 
range, lots of automation is needed behind the scenes. The exact aims here will be determined 
by the business strategy as we enter the Hurricane phase.

Platform connectivity simply means expanding the options for supported systems on the en-
ergy IoT (Internet of Things) level. This includes support for different types of Smart Metering 
systems, different renewable energy control and monitoring systems, different integration op-
tions with TSO and DSO grid data and more options to connect with different wholesale
markets. The exact targets will be determined by business strategy at the Hurricane stage. 
To support the decentralized virtual energy utility, from a technology point of view, means 
the capability to build and operate full microgrids end-to-end. To support the peer-to-peer 
energy marketplace concept, a system of compiling mass-market energy retail packages from 
certified green energy needs to be developed. These two concepts are not well-defined in the 
industry at this point - and WePower has a unique take on them. From a business and concept 
perspective they will be elaborated separately.

Currently, energy is a commodity. On more advanced open markets, where all customers have 
access to hourly market prices, energy utilities are investing in behind-the-meter IoT platforms 
and solutions to differentiate themselves, via offering energy optimization and additional com-
fort services. WePower platform, having reached Hurricane phase, will have one massive ad-
vantage when moving into the energy retail space. Having built up a trusted and transparent 
marketplace of green energy, we can offer the residential energy customer something unique 
- an emotional connection to power generation - for we can present exactly where the energy 
mix for the customer was actually produced and who owned it. Having this connection, com-
bined with easy and transparent energy trading and investment opportunities on the platform, 
will generate a strong incentive for mass market adoption of green energy. 

WePower Hurricane will allow the prosumer to buy and sell all energy via transparent smart 
contracts. It is intended for mature open energy markets with smart metering and data hubs 
deployed - whether one or multiple. It will feature integration with behind-the-meter control 
and monitoring devices for solar and storage. Machine learning and AI-powered residential 
asset performance analytics will provide capabilities for residential prosumers to participate

On the markets side, Hurricane will feature algorithmic trading for the hourly market, and su-
pervised, AI-assisted trading support for the day-ahead markets. 

The following figure shows the predicted scale of smart-metering roll-out in the EU, based on 
the European Commission’s data24.

We believe, that at this phase, the WePower platform will revolutionize the energy utility con-
cept and enable full competition against the incumbent large utility companies. Lacking most 
of the costs of traditional utility companies, with a strong green energy generation portfolio 
accessible via the trading platform, WePower will be in a far superior competitive position and 
therefore much more profitable.
