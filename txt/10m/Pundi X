PUNDI X ICO  5 

1. Introduction 
 

Satoshi Nakamoto’s seminal Bitcoin white paper proposed a revolutionary new digital 

currency. But it was based on its predecessor Hashcash and the proof-of-work concept was 

originally proposed by Dwork and Naor in 19921 as a means of combatting junk email. 

 

1.1. The success of Bitcoin 
So why did Bitcoin achieve such explosive economic value while its predecessors were mostly 

of academic interest only?  

 

1.2. Real Implementation 
More than just a white paper, “Satoshi” released the open source reference implementation in 

2009. Because Bitcoin itself was more than just a white paper, but an actual working system, 

it was able to capture the imagination of developers and leverage the paradigm of open source 

software development to quickly iterate and improve into a global-class financial 

infrastructure. 

 

1.3. Open Governance 
More importantly, Bitcoin is an open system that allows for evolution through forking and as 

such provides an assurance of its long term trustworthiness. If stakeholders ever get upset with 

the direction of Bitcoin, they can and already have produced forks that users and miners can 

migrate to if they see fit. 

 

1.4. The Problems of Bitcoin 
The biggest problem with Bitcoin at the moment is that it has not broken out into mainstream 

adoption. One study pegs the number of active cryptocurrency users to between 2.9 and 5.8 

million2. 

 

This paper proposes a solution for adding a billion users to the cryptocurrency movement by 

adding two key elements missing in order to provide significant adoption by mainstream users. 

 

The next billion users have not yet entered cryptocurrency for two main reasons: 

 

1.5. Too complicated 
Cryptocurrency suffers from complexity for the average user. Managing private keys, public 

keys, blockchain concepts—it’s all vastly out of the reach of the average user. In some cases 

the next Billion users may even barely be able to operate a smartphone.

PUNDI X ICO  6 

1.6. Not Relevant 
Today, the only thing you can buy with a cryptocurrency are other cryptocurrencies. The vast 

majority of people have no involvement with this process and no interest. Until the average 

user can use cryptocurrency to buy a bag of rice or a loaf of bread, the relevancy of 

cryptocurrency will be restricted to a small audience. 

 

1.7. The Solution 
This paper presents Pundi X, a platform for consumerizing cryptocurrencies by enabling their 

use in retail Point of Sale (POS) through a mobile app and contactless payment card. 

 

Following in the footsteps of Bitcoin, Pundi X has the same properties of Real Implementation, 

Open Governance and Incentivization that allows for the rapid global expansion of the solution. 

 

1.8. Real Implementation 
Pundi X is a complete end-to-end solution for contactless and mobile retail point-of-sale (POS) 

including a full-stack reference implementation of all the components. It includes a mobile 

application, a contactless smart card and point-of-sale (POS) terminals that are already in 

deployment. All of these components will be made widely available through open source and 

open specifications. 

 

1.9. Open Governance 
By releasing the full-stack reference implementations as open source and open specifications, 

we can enable ubiquitous distribution worldwide of the Pundi X protocols and ensure the 

rapid expansion of the value of the Pundi X Network. 

 

1.10. Incentivization 
The Pundi X network incentivizes participation through providing free hardware to retail stores 

in the initial target geography of Indonesia. Users are incentivized to participate in the Pundi 

X network through accessibility and ease of use and the convenience of mobile payment. 

 

With a solution that decreases complexity and adds relevance of cryptocurrencies to end users, 

we will see rapid mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and the merging of the crypto-

economy (current estimated value in October 2017 of 170B) with the much larger mainstream 

economy (estimated value 214T).

2. Vision
 

 
The Next Billion Crypto Users 
Pundi X will help to generate demand for new and old, as well as big and small 

cryptocurrencies. No other online cryptocurrency exchange can bring in new cryptocurrency 

users from this segment and in the same number, thanks to our powerful focus on attracting the 

consumer market.  

 

From 9 million to 100 million 

 With future growth in mind, let’s look at some relevant statistics as of October 2017: 

 

- Bitcoin price is approximately USD 6,000  
- Bitcoin market capitalization is approximately USD 100 billion 
- Trading frequency is 250,000 times 
- Trade volume is USD 900 million. 

 

With trading volume accounting for 1.1% of total volume, the reason bitcoin had such 

respectable numbers is because there may be as many as 5.8 and 11.5 million - an average of 

8.7 million - active wallets. However, the global bitcoin wallet ownership numbers do not 

even reach 2% of the population of South East Asia.

Just take a few seconds to absorb this information … what if we could introduce 

another 10 million, even 100 million users … what kind of impact would this have on 

the cryptocurrency landscape?

100 million users in 3 years 

 

Pundi X is concentrating initial traction efforts on South East Asia. Half of all South East 

Asians live in Indonesia. We have local team with a deep understanding of the Indonesian 

market - plus we have track record, connections and products to match the local market’s needs. 

 

We will spend the next two years building an extensive coverage of convenience stores, 

shopping malls, retail shops, chain outlets, cafe, restaurants and other outlets. We will use 

Pundi apps to coverage an even greater number of smaller sellers. Our goal is for users to be 

able to buy and spend cryptocurrency within a five minutes walk of any location in Jakarta. 

 

 

With our initial outreach in Indonesia, we intend to expand into Thailand, Malaysia, 

Singapore, Japan and other regional markets simultaneously. Our plan is to cover South East 

Asia within three years. At the same time we will explore other parts of Asia, the Americas 

and Europe using our open source and open specification for adoption of our protocol. In this 

way we can achieve our objectives in sales of cryptocurrency; usage of cryptocurrency; and 

growth of cryptocurrency. 

 

 

100 million to 1 billion in 5 years 

 

 Pundi X Platform will be provided as open source and the hardware reference 

implementation specifications will be provided under Creative Commons. The Pundi X 

solution will therefore be readily deployable across the world in regions outside of Indonesia. 

With these international deployments, Pundi X will be able to reach the 1 Billion user mark.

3. Mission

 

3.1. The next billion  
Cryptocurrencies, while capturing the imagination of 8 million people has almost no meaning 

or value to most of the world. 

 

Pundi X seeks to bring cryptocurrency to the next Billion users. 

 

3.2. Benefits  
By achieving this goal, Pundi X will help increase the value of cryptocurrency for all users.  

 

 

4. Problem

 

4.1 Complexity 
One of the hardest problems in crypto is how to radically reduce the complexity of handling 

cryptocurrency. Pundi X solves this problem through several end users layers including a 

mobile wallet and a contactless smart card. 

 

4.1.1.The Mobile Wallet 

 The mobile wallet is a helpful component because it solves the handling of private and 

public keys. Instead of managing a long and complicated blockchain public key, it may 

be preferable for end users to simply maintain a password-based system that is much 

more familiar. Increasingly mobile devices can be secured by fingerprint or face 

recognition, so even the password may become too complex for many users and in fact 

a point where the complexity can help create a security risk. 

 

4.1.2.The Smart Card 

The second layer that reduces even more complexity is the use of a smart card. The 

card can be used with or without the mobile app, and one member of the family could 

use the mobile app to charge up multiple cards that can be used by other members of 

the family.  

 

By empowering users with a contactless smart card, this enables users to avoid even 

the complexity of navigating a smartphone app. 

 

 

 

 

  

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  10 

4.1.3.The Pundi Platform 
 

The Pundi Platform is the final round-up in solving the complexity issue. As a both 

software and hardware, the full stack implementation allows the merchants to integrate 

their existing POS device by connecting with the Pundi Platform and accept payment 

in lieu of purchase/sale of cryptocurrencies and sale of daily goods & services. The 

hardware allows the use of the Smart Card and any Mobile Wallet, whereby addressing 

the inter-operability complexity. 

 

4.2 Relevance 
As mentioned before, the fact that most cryptocurrencies can only be used to buy other 

cryptocurrencies reduces the relevance of them to almost zero for most people. Thus the 

problem can be reduced to this: how can cryptocurrency be converted to fiat currencies for use 

in a “normal” everyday retail store to buy just about everything? And how can fiat currencies 

be used to buy cryptos just about anywhere? 

 

4.2.1.Crypto to fiat 

The standard way in crypto banking to solve the problem of Crypto to fiat for consumers 

is the “Bitcoin Debit Card”. This leverages the VISA and MasterCard networks and 

enables users to access as many as 43 million Point of Sale (PoS) terminals around the 

world. 

 

One of the problems that has cropped up in this space recently is that VISA and 

MasterCard have both blocked the access to their networks for crypto debit cards. So 

for many geographies, another solution will be needed. 

 

4.2.2.Crypto to crypto to fiat 

Pundi X offers support to point-of-sale devices through a full stack reference 

implementation of a contactless NFC mechanism that transacts directly with the 

cryptocurrency blockchain.  

 

The Point of Sale (POS) devices can become active on the Pundi X network through 

multiple means including: 

1) The full Pundi X reference implementation stack. Pundi X is giving the full hardware 
reference implementation to retail environments as their primary POS device in 

Indonesia. 

 

2) SDK –another easier approach is for existing POS device manufacturers to use the 
open source PundiX library to support crypto to crypto to fiat transfers. 

 

3) Mobile app—one of the easiest ways for a Point of Sale to include this payment 
protocol is simply to download the mobile app onto a compatible device, Some retail 

environments may even choose to use an Android phone or an iPhone (like the Apple 

Store) for customer checkout. Another approach would be to use an android or IOS 

tablet device with the software. 

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  11 

The existence of any of these solutions allows the point of sale to sell anything for 

cryptocurrency without the use of the VISA or Mastercard service by going directly to 

the cryptocurrency blockchain to record transactions. 

 

After these transactions are recorded, the Pundi X device or API reports back to Pundi 

to ensure that the merchants and retailers are paid back in fiat. 

 

4.2.3.Fiat to Crypto 

 How do Pundi X users buy cryptocurrencies? Three primary ways: 

 

1) The mobile wallet can allow users to directly purchase cryptocurrencies 
 

2) Mobile to card—users can transfer cryptocurrency from the mobile app to 
cards. An example of where this might be useful is if a member of the household has 

minor technical skills, they can set up crypto backed debit cards for the rest of the 

family and they don’t even need to worry about working a phone app. 

 

3) POS to card: for the simplest use case and for users who don’t even have 
smartphones, the Pundi X system enables the POS, whether it be the full hardware 

reference implementation, the mobile app or a tablet powered by the mobile app to 

directly be charged by a cryptocurrency. 

  



 

PUNDI X ICO  12 

5. Solution 

 
Pundi X aims to bring in the next billion crypto users as it allows users to buy 

cryptocurrency anywhere and anytime. This will make PundiX the world’s largest 

decentralized, offline cryptocurrency sales network. It is ‘decentralized’ because the ecosystem 

and transaction records live on the blockchain. It is ‘offline’ because our entry point is via 

Point-of-Sale (POS) devices installed in physical outlets.  

 

 

Pundi X allows for three customer use cases. It enables users to: 

1) Buy or Sell cryptocurrencies through a Point-of-Sale (PoS) device  
2) Buy anything using cryptocurrency through the Pundi X POS device (retail point-of-

sale) 

3) Pay peer-to-peer using mobile (like PayPal) 
 

 

Pundi X consists of: 

 Pundi X Mobile App - a smartphone app used to do the following things: 
- buy BTC, ETH, LTC, XEM, PXS and cryptocurrency using cash or card 
- sell BTC, ETH, LTC, XEM, PXS and cryptocurrency for cash 
- top up fiat money in a digital wallet 
- buy utilities and services, e.g. electricity using cryptocurrency * 

 

 PundiX card – will be the physical multi-currency wallet for fiat and cryptocurrencies 
available for purchase and sale via the PundiX platform. The PundiX card also 

facilitates payments via cryptocurrencies held in the card through NFC and contactless 

technology. 

 

 Pundi X Platform - a reference implementation stack including software and hardware 
that performs the full Point of Sale (POS) device function. Our reference 

implementation hardware is already in deployment in convenience stores and retailers, 

and we will further distribute the platform through open source licensing and 

distribution of the SDKS and open APIs. 

 
 

Effectively, PundiX will become: 

 

1. World’s largest offline cryptocurrency sales network by connecting existing POS 
devices and PundiX devices to the PundiX Platform 

2.Your very own Crypto debit card - Pundi X card 

3.An Offline Crypto exchange allowing for more liquidity in cryptocurrencies 

 

 

 

 
*The Pundi X business scope outlined above may be modified according to local laws and 

regulations, at the sole discretion of the management team. 

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  13 

6. Pundi X Mobile App 
 

 

Existing Pundi-Pundi apps are expected to promote the rapid growth of Pundi X. Since 

February 2017, Pundi-Pundi has over 100,000 downloads, achieving 20,000 monthly active 

users (MAUs). Today, over 500 retail outlets, restaurants and cafes accept our Pay-By-QR 

apps. Users are concentrated in Indonesia’s capital city of Jakarta with an eventual roll out 

planned across the whole of South East Asia. Pundi-Pundi is available on the iOS AppStore 

and on Google Play. 

 

We have also rolled out the Scanbersama, Pundi Booster and Pundi Toko, apps.  

- Scbersama is Indonesia’s universal QR payment SDK (Software Developer Kit) which 
enables any app to integrate with Scanbersama solutions using a single line of code. After 

integration these apps can be used to make payments at participating merchants. 

Scanbersama is available in SDK for our B2C clients for integration by app owners. 

 

- Pundi Booster is an app selling virtual goods or services. Merchants that have Pundi 
Booster can sell mobile talk time and enable utility bill payment via the app. Pundi 

Booster is available on Google Play.  

 

- Pundi Toko is the merchant management app for Pundi-Pundi and is available for 

download on Google Play. 

 
 

- More information is available at www.pundi-pundi.com and www.scanbersama.com.

PUNDI X ICO  14 

- You can download our apps on Google Play and iOS App Store. 

7. Pundi X Card  
 

 

The Pundi X card is the physical multi-currency (fiat and cryptocurrencies) wallet or a 

Crypto Debit card which can be loaded with cryptocurrencies via the POS devices which are 

connected to the PundiX platform. The PundiX card also facilitates payments via 

cryptocurrencies held in the card through NFC and contactless technology. 

 

With the future being Crypto, this physical debit card/wallet has a key use case in the 

event of theft of the mobile phone or loss of battery or no service coverage. The PundiX card 

will allow the easy onboarding of the next billion crypto users, who can get accustomed to 

using cryptocurrencies.  We also envisage several channels (Crypto Banks, Crypto Exchanges, 

POS device manufacturers, etc.) through which the PundiX card can potentially become a 

regular feature. 

 

8. Pundi X Platform 
 

 
 

Starting with Indonesia, the largest country in South East Asia, our team aims to provide 

retail outlets, restaurants and convenience stores with Pundi X Point-of-Sales (POS) devices so 

that customers can use the cryptocurrency held in their accounts to make daily purchases such 

as sugar and rice.* 



 

PUNDI X ICO  15 

 

In this way, Pundi X POS devices become the latest participants in the global blockchain 

and consumers benefit because they can use cash, credit card or a digital wallet to buy anything.  

 
* These purchases using Pundi X are carried out by first selling a fraction of a unit of cryptocurrency 

and buying the local fiat currency (Dollar, Rupiah etc.) and then local currency is used to buy 

products or services. For example, if a pack of sugar costs 1 US Dollar, users will sell approximately 

0.00025 BTCs (Bitcoins) for 1 dollar and then use fiat currency to buy the pack of sugar. (Rates are 

calculated in real time; the fiat currency selected is the local currency.) 

 

8.1. What is Pundi X Platform? 
The Pundi X POS is a smart device that is built to distribute cryptocurrency and is 

connected to the blockchain, so that each transaction is recorded. Consumers use Pundi X POS 

to buy physical goods using cryptocurrency * 

 

A software-only Pundi X POS is designed to run on Android and IOS tablets and is a 

special purpose version of the consumer mobile wallet app. 

 

Since each Pundi X POS device is connected to the web, software and feature updates 

can be performed remotely. For example, an update may introduce new blockchain features; 

schedule the sale of new ERC20 tokens; or arrange for a new cryptocurrency to be issued 

through an ICO. 

 
* These purchases using Pundi X are carried out by first selling a fraction of a unit of cryptocurrency 

and buying the local fiat currency first before using local fiat currency to purchase items. 

 

 

 

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  16 

8.2. Targeted growth: 100,000 devices in 3 years 
If the upcoming ICO reaches 35,000,000 tokens, our target for an installed base of Pundi 

X POS devices is 100,000 over 3 years. Since these devices constitute a big part of our cost, 

the amount raised during the ICO will determine device roll out numbers. For example, if we 

double the amount raised, our network will reach 220,000 Pundi X POS devices in three years, 

and so forth. For more detailed explanation please check Chapter 15.2. 

 

Our plan is to address the global market by implementing an agent-partnership model for 

markets where we cannot roll out our device immediately. Although our focus remains to roll 

out our full stack hardware solution, our aim of upgrading the current infrastructure (existing 

POS devices) globally will allow us to grow faster. 

 

 

Looking beyond South East Asia, we will be forming these agent-partnership models 

with the goal of introducing Pundi X POS devices in many other parts of the world within the 

next twelve months. 

 

 

  



 

PUNDI X ICO  17 

9. Pundi X Blockchain 
 

 
 

Every Pundi X POS device is connected to the Ethereum and NEM blockchain via 

XPlugins. As a result, each physical outlet is part of the Ethereum and NEM blockchain and 

developers from all over the world can connect with the Pundi X network of devices and 

physical outlets. 

 

9.1 Pundi X Management Platform 
The Pundi X Platform is a visual management system consisting of Pundi X POS 

devices and other existing POS devices. Every common man can login to the Pundi X Platform 

to buy or sell cryptocurrencies using the PundiX card and the Pundi-Pundi wallet App. All 

transactions that are executed by the PundiX devices are recorded in the blockchain for easy 

access and tracking. 

 

9.2. Connecting stores with Pundi X 

The target for Pundi X is to enable every POS device & retail store to be part of the 

blockchain ecosystem. With the Pundi X Platform, we now have a cost-effective approach to 

achieving this goal. Each device is connected to the blockchain using PundiX Platform API - 

XPlugins via two layers: the communication layer and the blockchain layer. The 



 

PUNDI X ICO  18 

communication layer delivers a ‘buy’ request and uses the blockchain layer to make a record 

of the sale. This information is then stored permanently in the blockchain. As a result, POS 

manufacturers all over the world can now collaborate with Pundi X. 

 

 

9.3. Selling cryptocurrency stores everywhere 

 

We allow developers as well as cryptocurrency traders and holders to sell their 

cryptocurrency via our sales network. Major Cryptocurrency and ERC20 tokens can be 

accepted and sold on Pundi X POS and developers can use XPlugins to connect to digital 

wallets, creating smart contract requests that can be supported by Pundi X devices. The system 

automatically generates a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain after receiving orders 

from XPlugins.  

 

9.4. Making payments using a digital wallet 
 

All ERC20 tokens can be used to make payments at Pundi X POS device locations. 

Developers can use digital wallets to connect to the Pundi X API and create a smart contract 

for any individual merchant. Developers can even set different transaction fees for different 

countries. Once a merchant approves a smart contract, the newly accepted cryptocurrency can 

be sold in a retail outlet enabling the purchase of everyday goods. 

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  19 

 

 

9.5. Connecting to other Cryptocurrency Exchanges 
 

Pundi X POS devices connects to different online cryptocurrency exchanges. Since 

each online cryptocurrency exchange has a different bid-ask spread and price level, users and 

merchants decide for themselves which platform best suits their individual needs. 

 

Users can choose their preferred cryptocurrency on various exchanges, and the market 

will help determine which platform offers the best combination of price and service. 

 

 

 



 

PUNDI X ICO  20 

 

10. Pundi X Token (PXS) 
 

 

PXS is the token used for Pundi X. Token purchaser, crypto traders, crypto developers and 

trading platform. They can also use PXS as “gas” to fuel transactions in the Pundi X ecosystem. 

For example, people who want to use the Pundi X sales network will have to buy PXS. As the 

Pundi X ecosystem grows, so will the demand for PXS and the earliest token purchaser will 

stand to benefit most. 

 

10.1. Supporting digital wallets on Pundi X 
 The Pundi-Pundi digital wallet app supports the Pundi X Wallet API; hence all Pundi 

X features will be carried across to the Pundi-Pundi app. For example, using the Pundi X 

Platform you can also buy on Pundi-Pundi.  

 

In the future the Pundi X Wallet API will be connected to a wide range of digital wallet 

apps. Many of our business partners’ digital wallet apps are in the process of integrating the 

APIs. All of these digital wallet apps will enjoy the benefit of access to the broad Pundi X 

ecosystem, including the ability to buy cryptocurrency directly within the app.

11. Progress to Date 
 

 
 

   Pundi X has been launched by the Pundi team which has already developed highly 

successful digital wallet apps for South East Asian markets that have grown rapidly to become 

some of Indonesia’s largest Pay-by-QR applications (think Alipay).  

 

Pundi X is aiming to become cryptocurrency’s largest offline sales network - (think 

Walmart or 7-Eleven) providing the first comprehensive online-to-offline cryptocurrency 

sales solution that includes:  

- a decentralized sales network 
- a multi-currency (fiat and crypto) wallet 
- a decentralized trading platform 
- a decentralized ICO platform 
 

Pundi-Pundi is already one of Indonesia’s largest QR payment application (think 

Alipay). 

 

  



 

PUNDI X ICO  22 

12. Roadmap 
 

12.1. Pundi X Platform 
We are currently identifying several channel partners to promote the Pundi X Platform and 

PundiX Card. In this instance, we have identified the following verticals: 

1. Existing POS Device Manufacturers – both hardware and tablet based (ex. Verifone, 
mSwipe, Kounta, InHouse, etc.) 

2. POS Software Developers  
3. Crypto Exchanges (ex. Kraken, Bitrex, etc.) 
4. Crypto Cards (ex. TenX) 
5. Crypto Banks 

 

 

12.2. Pundi X Banking 
Approximately 73% of the population of South East Asia does not have a bank account. 

In addition, tracking user credit ratings presents a major challenge without a workable credit 

rating system and so bank loan approval presents many difficulties.  

 

Consequently, Pundi X will collaborate with local financial institutions to create an 

effective credit rating system by addressing the biggest challenges of privacy and decentralized 

control by using blockchain technologies. 

 

12.2.1.Challenges of storing credit data 

Privacy is always a concern when it comes to storing data in the blockchain. Also, the 

cost and performance of storage are both important considerations:  If all the credit rating data 

generated by users was stored on the Ethereum blockchain today, the system might not be able 

to handle all the necessary data processing.  

 

12.2.2.Pundi X solution 

To solve this challenge, Pundi X has an API suite that connects to the Ethereum 

blockchain and stores user data in the blockchain in the form of a hash calculation. The aim is 

to store all data indefinitely - including utility bills history.  

 

Our approach is to store the hash results in the Ethereum blockchain instead of all the 

credit data. The hash data can then be retrieved and validated in order to check the full set of 

data stored outside of the blockchain. 

 

By accessing the open database and calculating the results into a hash, Pundi X partners 

can match their results with the hash that is stored in the Ethereum blockchain: if both results 

match then identity and data-integrity is validated. 

 

By avoiding storing all data in the Ethereum blockchain, we have developed a cost-

effective method that also effectively addresses privacy issues. Today, no user data is stored in 



 

PUNDI X ICO  23 

the Ethereum blockchain, only hashes. Financial institutions can now retrieve credit rating data 

effectively and perform further calculations on their own servers, while avoiding impinging on 

client privacy. 

 

 

 

12.2.3.Pundi X advantages  

 

Due to its successful growth, Pundi X has a wealth of transactions and other data that 

is mapped to a wallet or blockchain address, while Pundi-Pundi has a great deal of user 

data such as names, occupation and credit card information. Together, Pundi X and Pundi-

Pundi hold a huge data pool from which anonymized information can be extracted 

responsibly in order create huge value. This is something that other startups companies are 

not in a position to achieve.

PUNDI X ICO  25 

13. Token Release 
 

 

In this ICO, Pundi X will be issuing ERC20 compliant tokens with the ticker “PXS”.   

 

13.1. PXS 3-year release program 
We accept Ethereum (ETH) during the ICO and the basic exchange rate between ETH 

and PXS is 1 ETH = 1666.67 PXS3 subject to holding for Three (3) years (36 months) and 

fulfill the KYC requirement.  However, purchaser will only receive 500 PXS (30%) at the 

moment, the rest of the 1166.67 PXS (70%) will be entitled only if the Purchaser holds for 3 

years (36 months).  We will release the rest of the 70% of the PXS token on a monthly basis. 

Therefore, purchaser who does not hold PXS for 36 months shall be penalized getting lesser 

PXS token. 

 

In short, the Total receiving token is 1 ETH: 1666.67 PXS; The Initial receiving token 

is 500 PXS, and the Locked token is 1166.67 Token subject to terms and conditions. 

 

13.2. Selling PXS on our platform 
PXS is a key component of the Pundi X ecosystem. Any company or individual that wants 

to connect to the Pundi X sales network will have to pay a transaction fee in PXS. Hence anyone 

that wants to do business in the network will have to buy PXS from the market. 

 

 

13.3. The PXS discounts 
As a token holder, when you shop at any outlet that supports Pundi X payments, you will 

get an additional discount. Whether you are in Bali, Phuket, Bangkok, or anywhere else in the 

world, you will receive significant benefits according to your status as a Gold, Platinum, 

Diamond or Black card holder: 

 

- Black Card (Ranked 1 - 50); 5% discount for 10 years； 

- Diamond Card (Ranked 51 - 150); 5% discount for 5 years； 

- Platinum card (Ranked 151 - 300); 5% discount for 3 years; 
- Gold card (Ranked > 300; Contributed >10 ETH); 5% discount for 1 year. 
 

* Each PXS token holder can only enjoy the special privilege based on one card type. Time limits 

starts from card issuance date. 

  

                                                 
3 The exchange rate might be varied from different discount rate.

15. ICO 
 

 

15.1. ICO details 
Notes: 

- We accept ETH for PXS  
- Ratio of 1 ETH = 500 PXS 
- This ICO is not an IPO (Initial Public Offering) 
- Pre-ICO: Token purchaser can visit the Pundi X website before the ICO to pre-register with 

their email address. Token purchaser will enjoy extra benefit based on the pledged amount.  

- PXS amount: If this ICO does not generate 35,000,000 PXS tokens in sales, the company 
reserves the right to use the remaining tokens for a second ICO. The token price for any 

second ICO would be greater than in this round. The management reserves the right to 

terminate this ICO and, if this decision is taken, all ETH fund will be returned to the original 

token purchaser. 

 

 

15.2. ICO hard cap 
 Our hard cap will be 35 million US dollars. Regardless of how the price or 

cryptocurrency changes, our target will be the same. The number of Pundi X POS device 

distributed will be based on the number of tokens we are able to raise from this ICO. 

 

 

Total ETH raised Number of POS machine Remarks 

70,000 100,000 The Marginal Cost of the 
device will reduce 
significantly as the 
number goes up 

100,000 150,000 

 

 The greater amount of funds raised from the ICO, the more Pundi X POS’s production, 

installation, operation and marketing costs can be reduced. The device numbers will also create 

a network effect where more people will use Pundi X POS to buy and trade cryptocurrency, 

and more sellers will sell goods and services on our sales network.  

 

15.3. PXS release scheme 
 

We accept Ethereum (ETH) during the ICO and the basic exchange rate between ETH 

and PXS is 1 ETH = 1666.67 PXS4 subject to holding for Three (3) years (36 months) and 

fulfill the KYC requirement.  However, purchaser will only receive 500 PXS (30%) at the 

                                                 
4 The exchange rate might be varied from different discount rate. 



 

PUNDI X ICO  28 

moment, the rest of the 1166.67 PXS (70%) will be entitled only if the Purchaser holds for 3 

years (36 months).  We will release the rest of the 70% of the PXS token on a monthly basis. 

Therefore, purchaser who does not hold PXS for 36 months shall be penalized getting lesser 

PXS token. 

 

In short, the Total Receiving token is 1 ETH: 1666.67 PXS; The Initial receiving token 

is 500 PXS (30%), and the Locked token is 1166.67 PXS(70%) is subject to terms and 

conditions. 

  

For simplicity, we will only show 1 ETH = 500 PXS on our official website. 

  

For this round, ICO token purchaser will hold 20% of the total PXS token supply; while 

the founders, management, company, advisors and ICO marketing expenses will together hold 

another 10%. (For details please see 11.6). The remaining 70% of the tokens will be released 

based on Proof-of-Stake to all token holders including the founders, management, company, 

advisors and marketing campaign. 

  

The system will release the rest of the PXS tokens based on the percentage of the PXS 

tokens that a holder possesses immediately after the first month of the ICO campaign. The 

entire release scheme will last for 3 years.   

         

       The system will determine the PXS tokens amount after the ICO, and based on that we 

will be able to determine the precise PXS tokens released each month. Users can login to our 

website to check the monthly PXS tokens released. The system will release the tokens from 

the token pool. 

   

       When the entire remaining tokens are released, the PXS tokens will reach almost 100%, 

and the outstanding minuscule percentage will be distributed in the final month.  We will 

announce the detailed PXS release scheme and the exact release percentage each month after 

the ICO. 

 

 

So how do we calculate?  

 If 35,000,000 tokens are created from this ICO, Alice contributes 1 ETH, which she 

shall be entitled of 1666.67 PXS. She will receive 500 PXS by the time she pledges, the rest of 

the 1166.67 PXS token will be released in the next 36 months. On the first day of the 6th month 

after the ICO she will have over 763 PXS (500+263), on the first day of the 10th month she will 

have 1013 PXS (500+513), on the first day of the 16th month she will have 1268 PXS 

(500+768) ; On the first day of the 24th month she will have 1500 PXS (500+1000); On the 

first day of the 36th  month she will have 1666.67 PXS (500+1166.67). During this period Alice 

will need to execute the smart contract and fill in the KYC form as stipulated to unlock the 

tokens. 

 

* due to the fact that we will only be able to calculate the exact token distribution after the ICO. The 
smart contract token distribution will be generated after the ICO to determine the exactly monthly 



 

PUNDI X ICO  29 

distribution amount. ICO token holders can visit our website for more details or query the smart 

contract directly. 

 

 

15.4. Release scheme implementation 
 From the 1st to 10th of every month, token holders can execute the smart contract in 

any ERC20 supported wallet to know the exact PXS tokens from the previous month. They 

will also be able to claim the bonus tokens based on the monthly basis. Execution steps are as 

below: 

A. User executes smart contract in an ERC20 wallet and fill in the KYC form in official 
website; 

B. Release scheme starts on the second month after receiving PXS, user can choose to 
execute the smart contract from any of the 2nd till the 7th month, in order to receive 

the release tokens from the previous 1st till the 6th month; 

C. Smart contract determines the number of tokens in an address from the previous month 
(final day at 23:59), if the smart contract detects that user have not claimed the release 

tokens for several months, it will then determines the unclaimed released tokens of each 

month (final day at 23:59), and returns all released tokens; 

D. Tokens unclaimed more than six months will be forfeited. Each time a smart contract 
is executed, the maximum release tokens are for a maximum of six months; 

E. Calculation: determine the month(s) of PXS token counts of each month (final day at 
23:59) of an address, multiply by the month(s)  to determine the release token numbers; 

F. On the last day of each month, Pundi X will activate a smart contract to determine 
unclaimed bonus tokens over six months, unclaimed bonus tokens will be announced 

and kept for further usage; 

G. All times are GMT+8. 

 

Note: The Release scheme will kick start from 1st December 2017. Token holders join 

after 30th November 2017 23:59 shall only entitled to 35 months release distribution

15.6. Reserved PXS 
Based on the number of tokens created during the ICO, we will create an additional 

portion for our founders, management, company, advisors and for payment for ICO marketing 

expenses.  

 

Assume in this ICO ‘A’ amount of PXS is created, the percentage of tokens will be 

distributed for the additional portions are: 

 

- ‘A’ x 25% to the founders and management; 
- ‘A’ x 20% to the company, reserved for current and future employees; 
- ‘A’ x 5% to the advisors and ICO marketing expenses. 
- Reserved tokens will be unlocked at a rate of 10% each month. 
 

Calculation: 

For example after the conclusion of the ICO, if we have created 35,000,000 Tokens, the  

reserved tokens created on top of the tokens from the ICO are indicated below: 

- 8,750,000 tokens for founders and management; 
- 7,000,000 tokens for company, reserved for current and future employees; 
- 1,750,000 tokens for advisors and ICO marketing expenses.
