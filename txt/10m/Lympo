ABSTRACT

The usage of mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearables is ever-growing. More than 52% of 

smart phone users gather health-related information on their phone. In 2016 alone, mHealth 

app store downloads totalled 3.2 billion. Health-related data is a

precious asset for both individuals and stakeholders in the data-driven sports, health and 

wellness industry.

However, the users generating this data cannot aggregate, share and monetize it.

Moreover, because it lacks the means to interconnect existing data, the industry cannot unlock 

its full potential for the benefit of all market players. The rise of mHealth applications has not 

yet delivered on the promise of digital technology empowering individuals and resulting in 

better health care and a more connected sports and

wellness market.

The Lympo ecosystem resolves this problem. Powered by user-generated and

user-controlled fitness and wellness data, Lympo will allow the exchange of value through the 

introduction LYM utility tokens. Lympo’s goal is an ecosystem where data is used e�ciently by 

all industry stakeholders and everyone is rewarded fairly. It

consists of three pillars: the Lympo fitness wallet, a marketplace and the Lympo crowdfunding 

platform.

The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user reward mechanism is at the core of the Lympo 

ecosystem. The wallet functions as an entry to the ecosystem and allows users to be rewarded 

in LYM tokens for their healthy lifestyle achievements. 

These tokens can be used to purchase goods and services in a marketplace starting from an 

existing Lympo platform uniting more than 500 fitness professionals and later expanding to a 

broad network of sports, wellness and health goods and services

providers. Finally, LYM tokens will be used on the Lympo crowdfunding platform to invest in 

innovative data driven companies in the industry which will contribute to the growth of this 

new ecosystem.

CHALLENGES OF THE MOBILE HEALTH DATA 
INDUSTRY

The digital health market is exploding both in number of new companies and with the expected 

market size of $233.3 billion by 2020. Much of growth is predicted to come from the mobile 

health (mHealth) market. In 2016 alone, the estimated total number of mHealth apps increased 

57%2. In that same year, the number mHealth app store downloads totalled 3.2 billion, with 52% 

of smartphone users gathering health-related information on their phone3. Most newer phones 

have inbuilt health-related data gathering capacities predicating this number to soar in the 

upcoming years. 

What data are we gathering? Over the years, the fastest-growing mHealth sector was the 

fitness and wellness domain with a projected compound annual growth (CAGR) of 48.1%4 . 65% 

of all mHealth apps in the U.S. connect to wellness services, among which fitness has a strong 

leadership position with 36% of the total apps. Top categories also include weight loss, exercise, 

women’s health, sleep and meditation. 

FROM WELLNESS TO NOT-SO-WELLNESS

At the same time, since 2005 the sports & wellness market has almost doubled from 46 to over 

90 billion US dollars. All key market players in this industry: from personal trainers, gyms, sports 

apparel and healthy food producers to health insurers and companies aiming to incentivize a 

healthy lifestyle among their employees, could benefit from cross-platform fitness and wellness 

data exchange. Nevertheless, the data which users track every day remains confined by a single

provider or a small network of partners at best, and said user has very limited ways to share it.

Notwithstanding, the growing market and the extensive use of mHealth apps have not yet 

deliver on the promise of digital technology that empowers individuals and results in better 

health care and a more connected sports and wellness market. The crucial shortages: 1. We are 

not the owners of the quantified self; 2. mHealth apps do not integrate with each other.  3. Due 

to restricted data flow, sports and wellness market lacks connectivity.

MAJOR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES
OWNERSHIP

In 2011, the World Economic Forum announced personal data to be a new asset class. Among 

all data classes, health related data is one of the most valued and expensive assets. However, it 

turns out that our personal data is not our personal asset.

The quantified self is a term denoting “self-knowledge through self-tracking”. While it might 

have been a voluntary movement back in 20075, nowadays we are all voluntarily or

involuntarily part of this movement if we use a smartphone with health data tracking, any 

mHealth app or a fitness wearable. The problem is that while we are busy quantifying ourselves, 

the companies whose products we are using are busy collecting our data and generating 

profits from it. And this is a big concern for users.

A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that “many health apps may 

be sharing patients’ health data without their knowledge”6. Another study on reducing

cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with the help of mHealth apps and wearables concludes that:

Mobile health technology has shown the potential to optimize the management of CVD 

and other chronic diseases by empowering patients through better health self-monitoring 

and education. However, several challenges are present when patient’s data are utilized and 

monitored in the healthcare setting. A common issue is the privacy and security of health 

information7.

https://humandatacommons.org/pdfs/HumanDataCommons_QS_ReportCard_2017.pdf

Furthermore, CVDs are the number one cause of death globally: more people die annually from 

CVDs than from any other cause. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 17.7 

million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths. At the same time, 

WHO stresses that “most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural 

risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use 

of alcohol”8. 

Thus, incentivizing healthy behaviour is one of the crucial challenges for health innovations. At 

Lympo, we believe that part of the answer is allowing users to own the data they generate. 

Lympo presents a health/fitness app data aggregator that does not share users’ data, but 

enables them to monetize it instead.

TO SUM UP:

We are not the owners of one of the most valuable assets we have, our health-related data, 

although we constantly gather this data voluntarily or involuntarily.

INTEGRATION

An additional problem with the mHealth sector is that the market is very segmented. Most apps 

focus on one specific area, while each of the providers gather only very specific information, 

thus lacking an overall picture. While various aggregators that allow integration exist, users are 

reluctant to connect their apps and wearables to them because there is no real advantage for a 

user to have this data in one place: aggregators rarely answer the question “What’s next?”. 

Usually integration only means that a user is transferring more data to one app provider with 

no reward mechanism for its user. Thus, the interaction stays mostly limited to occasional data 

sharing on social media.

In addition to this, numerous research accounts show that privacy is the number one concern 

for mHealth users. Most companies o�ering possibilities to integrate data are big players like 

Apple, Google or Microsoft that regardless own a lot of users’ data and do not inspire the trust 

that is needed to store sensitive health information in one place. The 2017 report by Human 

Data Commons reveals that big corporations with extensive capacities to integrate data are 

weakest in terms of providing direct human contact for consumers9.

These challenges make it di�cult for a user to have all generated data in one place. While such 

a data set would be very valuable for getting feedback from a sports or mindfulness coach, 

physical therapist and even a general practitioner, it remains scattered among a variety of apps 

and devices.



7

TO SUM UP:

Market segmentation and lack of incentive for mHealth apps’ integration prevents users from 

having an overall picture of all their activities or further reaping key benefits of the data they 

generate.

FREE DATA FLOW

In the world of data economy, users produce valuable data with literally every step they make. 

However, because it remains stored with a single provider, every ecosystem player is

participating in the race to come up with a better mechanism to lock a user within one

platform. For this reason, market players become discouraged to o�er integration and data 

sharing mechanisms. 

The second factor contributing to this situation are data protection laws that, for good reasons, 

prevent companies from freely sharing users’ personal data not only with other businesses, but 

also within the company itself if its operations are across, for example, EU-U.S. borders.

Allowing private ownership of sports and health data opens the doors to user-controlled data 

sharing whereby the information flow can be managed by the individual.

The sports and wellness market includes a wide variety of players who cover various aspects of 

user behaviour like choosing a fitness trainer, an exercise regime, a gym, healthy diet and 

supplements, sports clothes and shoes. Healthy lifestyle enthusiasts owning the data collected 

from a variety of sources could make the best use of it by connecting multiple industry

products and services that enable all key players to profit from this free flow of data.

TO SUM UP:

Due to the lack of a mechanism allowing users to e�ectively share their sports and health 

data, the sports and wellness industry cannot o�er user-centred products and services for 

all aspects of a healthy lifestyle.



THE HEALTH INDUSTRY AND THE
BLOCKCHAIN

HOW CAN BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS THE BIGGEST
FITNESS/WELLNESS DATA MANAGEMENT
PROBLEMS?

It is widely agreed that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the health sector by 

making user-generated data the core of the healthcare ecosystem. It can achieve this by 

increasing the security and interoperability of health data. In this paper, we focus on mHealth or 

more specifically on the fitness/wellness sector powered by mHealth apps and wearables. 

However, it is important to grasp the whole picture to realise Lympo’s full potential in the future. 

Blockchain is a distributed system which records and stores transaction records, in a fashion 

making it impossible to change the content of the transaction in a digital ledger. Each

transaction block is stored in the ledger and chronologically linked to another block after the 

transaction records are verified by a distributed peer-to-peer network. End-to-end encryption 

makes an interaction like storing, exchanging and viewing information possible without

established trust between the parties. Avoiding one central authority, blockchain relies on an 

anonymous network of participants preventing privacy and confidentiality breaches.

Blockchain-based smart contracts represent contracts that can be fully executed when

contract conditions are met. This system unbundles the need for any kind of exchange with an 

intermediary checking contract conditions. Until now, intermediaries played a crucial role in 

exchange of value situations, thus earning from their role. Smart contracts enable end users to 

enter a trusted relationship without any other authority. 

The sensitive nature of health-related data and the need to be able to delete this personal data 

in order to fulfil data protection regulations in some parts of the world (most notably the 

European Union) does not allow for storing this data itself on blockchain. In this case,

blockchain technology is viewed as a secure and e�ective payment tool allowing

micro-payments and a permission storing mechanism.

Registering permissions to access patient-generated data on blockchain, users are empowered 

to control who can access their data, and under which conditions. This capability enables 

individuals to be the owners of their precious data asset. This data set can be compiled from 

information originating from a variety of data sources; ranging from electronic medical records 

provided by hospitals, clinics and doctors, to fitness/wellness data generated by mHealth apps 

and wearables. It can also be complimented by disease and treatment monitoring applications 

and custom information added by a user individually.

In addition, further data users will be able to demonstrate that the data owner gave her

permission for the use of this data. With data protection regulations tightening around the 

world, this feature will enable third parties to give solid proof on data provenance on the

blockchain.

BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS IN THE HEALTH
INDUSTRY

Healthcare might be a latecomer in the booming growth of enterprise blockchain apps, but it is 

getting more and more prominence as a promising technology to solve major issues in the 

sector of health data management even on a governmental scale.

LYMPO: ECOSYSTEM POWERED BY
USER-GENERATED DATA

INTRO: HOW IT WORKS?

Lympo aims to create an ecosystem powered by user-generated and user-controlled fitness 

and wellness data allowing the exchange of value through the introduction of LYM utility 

tokens. Lympo’s goal is a marketplace where data itself is used e�ciently by ecosystem mem-

bers and everyone is rewarded fairly. A mHealth app/wearable user is at the centre of this 

ecosystem including all key players in the sports and wellness industry:

The Lympo ecosystem starts from the existing platform which enables users to find the best 

personal trainer with 500+ fitness professionals operational in Lithuania, www.lympo.lt, and 

expanding to California, U.S. and Melbourne, Australia. 

The ecosystem is composed of three main parts: 1. The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user 

reward mechanisms; 2. Lympo marketplace; 3. Lympo crowdfunding and investment platform.

I PART: THE LYMPO WALLET AND USER REWARDS 
MECHANISM

The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user reward mechanism is at the core of the Lympo 

ecosystem. Lympo fitness wallet functions as an entry to the ecosystem and allows a user to 

create their profile, fill in their health data and connect it to their favourite sports and health 

tracking apps. The individual data submitted via Lympo fitness wallet will be accessible to its 

user and can be viewed or shared by storing a permission on blockchain. 

The rewards issued by market players interested in having direct access to Lympo digital fitness 

wallet users can be of two di�erent types:

A reward for achieving a healthy lifestyle goal, i.e. running 5 kilometres or following a precise 

diet and submitting app records to Lympo profile.

A reward for checking into a particular location for a specified amount of time, i.e. joining a 

gym class or attending a karate competition. 

 

The Lympo health wallet will be rolled out in multiple steps. In order to bring the product to the 

market as soon as possible, Lympo tokens will be first used as utility tokens on the existing 

Group challenges enhancing team 
building

Health and fitness apps Promoting a health or fitness app, 
searching for innovative ways to 
strengthen consumer engagement

Added value for customers

Interaction with a wide client base

Fitness/wellness/health start-ups Spreading own ideas and early stage 
products, searching for mentors and 
business partners, seeking investment

Access to investors interested in the 
industry

Industry experts’ reviews and
mentorship

Opportunity to easily find business 
partners

Investors Searching for innovative companies, 
seeking community due diligence

Carefully pre-selected start-ups

Reviews and ratings by industry 
experts

Lympo platform to buy online and o�ine training sessions with the best fitness trainers,

including training or any sports coach sessions, consultations by a physical therapist or a 

dietician. Lympo users will be able to utilise the Lympo fitness wallet to get reward tokens for 

achieved training goals. As more partners join, Lympo tokens will be used to access a wide 

range of healthy lifestyle products and services like sports clothes and shoes, healthy food and 

gyms with a possibility to reward achieved health goals with the help of smart contracts. 

Trainers will be able to be more competitive, proposing packages where their services are 

o�ered together with a built-in reward program.  Also, any other ecosystem player can either 

attach the reward system to the product sold or purchase a certain number of tokens and 

organise challenges and tasks for Lympo users in exchange for their data.

Use case I: Lympo users receive a notification that a challenge to run 5 km this week is being 
organised by a big athletic shoe producer. No matter which app they use, they can complete 
this task and get token rewards with the Lympo platform.

Use case II: a new boxing club in the city notifies users in this city that a certain number of 

tokens will be distributed to those attending their first boxing class for beginners. Users 

check-in to a club location at the specific time using their Lympo account and get LYM reward 

tokens. 

A further service o�ered by the Lympo platform is a time-stamped permission issued by users 

to utilise their personal data. This is key to ensure the highest data protection regulation

standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. 

II PART: LYMPO MARKETPLACE: MONETIZING 
DATA

The next step in the Lympo ecosystem is to enable users to spend tokens to receive further 

healthy lifestyle goods and services and make in-platform purchases. The marketplace, starting 

with the existing platform to find the best personal trainer, o�ers a variety of ways to do so:

Getting premium features in the Lympo platform. E.g.: 

A personal trainer can buy enhanced profile options and more exposure for their listing.

A user can purchase more options for their health and sports data storage on the Lympo 

platform, like reminders and health advice based on the data submitted.

Everyone owning tokens will receive discounts and products o�ered by our partners: sports 

and wellness businesses, healthy food and supplement providers, etc.

Businesses use tokens to pay for listing their products and services on the platform. 

Lympo foresees its existing platform to be the market entry tool for the user-generated data 

powered healthy lifestyle ecosystem which will further expand with more partners accepting 

LYM tokens. A part of LYM tokens are allocated to incentivize community growth and to add 

new businesses to the Lympo network. The ultimate Lympo goal is that its token holders can 

access a wide range of products and services with the initial platform being only one part of 

the much wider network.

At this later stage, the user-generated data marketplace will open for businesses such as health 

insurances, research institutions, and big data companies within and outside of the sports and 

wellness industry that are interested in accessing the data of Lympo digital wallet users. The 

users will be enabled to decide whom they trust their data to, to know what exactly they are 

sharing and to earn tokens by doing so.

III PART: LYMPO CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM

The third arm of the Lympo ecosystem is a crowdfunding and investment platform allowing

LYM token holders to invest in the most promising fitness/wellness/health start-ups which are 



Great incentives for a healthier lifestyle

Data-based management decisions 
powered by clients’ data

reviewed and rated by Lympo ecosystem members who know what the industry needs best. 

LYM token holders will be able to receive company shares for the tokens contributed. 

The unique value proposition of this crowdfunding platform is 1. Public reviews and ratings by 

sports and wellness market players; 2. Access to data of a big user base enabled by LYM 

tokens.

The crowdfunding platform will allow for businesses and service providers active in the 

Lympo ecosystem to review and rate new companies seeking investment for a certain token 

reward o�ered by a start-up listed. This will help investors to better evaluate the potential of 

the new venture and for start-ups to find potential partners and customers operating within 

the same industry. 

Many new companies are following the usual data economy business cycle: build a product, 

attract a large user base, then start analysing and monetising data. But with the help of 

invested LYM tokens, start-ups on the Lympo crowdfunding platform will be able to start 

working with a big data base immediately purchasing fitness and health data directly from 

our users or proposing new challenges for reward tokens if the existing data set lacks some 

particular qualities.

This way, new innovative fitness/wellness/health companies will have a much lower market 

entry cost and can successfully launch their products and maximise returns for investors.

LYMPO BLOCKCHAIN FOR SPORTS FOUNDATION

A part of the tokens reserved for the ecosystem empowerment will be allocated to Lympo 

Blockchain for Sports Foundation. The aim of this foundation is to support various sports 

events and initiatives around the world with the goal to promote Lympo fitness wallet and to 

encourage a healthy lifestyle. 

The foundation board, composed of famous athletes, Lympo partners and leaders in sports 

communities from various countries, will oversee the foundation activities. Lympo token holders 

of at least 1,000,000 LYM (the amount will be adjusted in two years based on community vote) 

will be able to vote on funding proposals. The composition of the board and foundation

governing principles will be announced before the Lympo token sale in the first quarter of 2018.

LYMPO: USER REWARD SOLUTION
DESCRIPTION

While Lympo includes three major parts, a user reward mechanism, a marketplace and a crowd-

funding platform, rewards for a healthy lifestyle are at the core of the product and will be 

discussed in detail. We have also included a provisional model of the data sharing environment 

with description of components, permissions and actors.

The fitness/health data sharing ecosystem is based on three major components: 

Lympo Platform: core components developed by the Lympo team and partners

Blockchain: Lympo tokens, smart contracts and crypto wallets

User community: Users, who will live healthy lifestyles and will interact with di�erent actors 

in the ecosystem to find trainers, partners, make agreements, share data and get rewarded. 

The Lympo tokens are a key element which facilitate all interaction in the system in relation to 

the community and a healthy lifestyle. The tokens are used to incentivize people to be active 

participants, make connections and improve their health. The tokens are distributed on the 

Ethereum cryptocurrency blockchain. This, of course, imposes certain standard rules for the 

community.

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

Lympo Core Main business logic will be implemented in this component. The component will 
contain all relevant rules and algorithms processing activities in the ecosystem. It will 
do data validation and will interact with blockchain to process contracts and issue 
some transactions, when needed. 

Lympo API A collection of various programming functions and interfaces to make Lympo 
ecosystem accessible for the software development companies. The API will give 
su�cient flexibility, while respecting all security rules implemented in Lympo Core. 
Lympo will encourage third parties to create additional services in the ecosystem, 
which will be beneficial for system users and investors. 

Main Data store The database where all system data will be stored. It will include user accounts, 
system data and detailed information about the smart contracts. The fitness data 
recorded by Lympo users will also be stored in this data storage. The elaborated 
security measures will be taken to protect the data, and it will only interact with 
Lympo Core system, which will make sure that only authorized persons and 
processes can access relevant data.

Lympo User Interface Web portal and mobile applications developed by the Lympo team. The user 
interface will be the main entry point for the users to create and manage their Lympo 
accounts, propose di�erent training programs and reward options, pay for the 
services, create smart contracts and monitor the balance of the Lympo tokens in 
their accounts.

19

Data Access Engine A separate component in the Lympo Core, developed exclusively to add extra 
security checks for the data shared with the third parties. External developers will 
get access to the system via Lympo API, however the private data is a big concern 
and requires additional handling. Permissions to access the data can be given by the 
data owner only, and this component will perform validation of these permissions. In 
addition, the data access engine will audit every external call to the API, therefore 
every user will be able to see who has accessed their data. Moreover, the component 
will do automatic monitoring of system behaviour, to analyse data usage patterns 
and alert system administrators on malicious behaviour. 



BLOCKCHAIN: SMART CONTRACTS

The Lympo ecosystem will use Lympo Token as a main facilitator of the user contracts and 

interactions. The unique user community and collection of the fitness/wellness data gives a 

wide range of opportunities for smart contracts and data exchange. The Lympo team takes 

user privacy very seriously, therefore all source code for the smart contracts related to the data 

exchange, will be fully verified by the Lympo developers. In addition, Lympo core will stay as 

authorizing entity for the agreements and rewards. Already at this early stage several examples 

of the smart contracts will be implemented:

SMART CONTRACT: USER REWARD PROGRAM

User reward programs, will be made between the Lympo ecosystem participants, such as 

trainers/physicians/gyms/sports inventory providers and Lympo digital fitness wallet users. Let 

us look at a case of a fitness trainer and her client. In order to encourage users to live a healthy 

lifestyle, the fitness trainer will propose a contract on the Lympo platform, giving specific goals 

for the end user to achieve. The contract itself will be made using standard user interface. The 

components of such contract are the following:

Account of the person/company which is creating a contract

Account of the end user who will receive the rewards, after reaching the goals

The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be transferred as a reward

The detailed description of activities and goals, which needs to be met. This information will 

be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the smart contract. 

The creator of the smart contract will use all the parameters from above and will sign the call to 

blockchain with his/her password. The smart contract will lock the reward tokens for a given 

number of days. After the user reaches training goals specified in the contract, the Lympo Core 

validates this information, and invokes the call to a smart contract, confirming transfer of the 

Lympo tokens to the user. If the goals are not met during the agreed time, the tokens will be 

transferred back to the Lympo platform or the creator of the smart contract depending on the 

conditions for the specific token reward program.  

TRAINING PACKAGE USING A REWARD PROGRAM SMART
CONTRACT

The Lympo system will give options for the trainers/physicians to propose training packages, 

which automatically would include a reward program. The trainers will be free to choose how 

they advertise their services in the system, but to be competitive, the pricing might contain an 

option for the user to get back a specific percentage of payment. The implementation of the 

smart contract is very similar to previously defined model. However, in this case the workflow 

will have a few additional steps: 

20



Trainer in the Lympo system creates a package to o�er a customer. The package contains: 

Trainer services (detailed description)

Price for a whole package

The percentage which will be given as reward after goals are achieved

Conditions to get the reward (similar as specified in the smart contract above)

Trainer sends this information to the smart contract (signing with his/her blockchain 

account). Some parts will be set directly (like the price, percentage, etc.). Other details will 

be hashed into one string and stored in the smart contract as a proof. 

When a user finds a package which he/she wants to purchase, the Lympo system will

additionally verify that the information signed by the trainer in the smart contract is correct. 

The user then makes a transaction to the smart contract using Lympo tokens. A part of the 

tokens is immediately transferred to the trainer's account, but a specified percentage of 

them are automatically locked by the smart contract. 

Unlocking is similar to the contract defined sabove: after the user reaches training goals speci-

fied in the contract, Lympo Core validates this information and invokes the call to a smart 

contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens back to the user. If the goals are not met 

during the agreed time, the tokens will be transferred to the trainer. 

SMART CONTRACT – CUSTOM REWARD PROGRAM FOR 
CHECK-INS

Various companies will be able to attract users by creating specific locations where users can 

receive LYM tokens just for showing up and staying during a specific time. The smart contract 

will be signed by these companies, and the main goal of it will be to have a specific number of 

tokens locked for the distribution to the end users. The components of this smart contract 

would be the following: 

Account of the person/company which is creating a reward program

The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be shared by all participating users as a reward

The detailed information on the conditions and rules for sharing the tokens. This information 
will be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the smart contract. 

21

Unlocking is similar to the contract defined sabove: after the user reaches training goals

specified in the contract, Lympo Core validates this information and invokes the call to a smart 

contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens back to the user. If the goals are not met 

during the agreed time, the tokens will be transferred to the trainer. 

All conditions related to the reward program will be detailed in the Lympo portal. Participants 

will use their mobile devices to track their location and will provide this information to the 

system. Lympo will o�er a possibility to issue a security or a QR code to be placed at the 

location as an additional fraud protection mechanism. After the specified time, the Lympo core



22

will use the information received from users, will calculate the rewards and will send the

information to the smart contract per which accounts shall receive tokens.

SMART CONTRACT: DATA ACCESS 

The smart contract will be created by the data proxy companies in order to reward users, when 

the fitness data is fetched. The data proxy companies, could create interfaces for various data 

processing companies, who need such data. This data access contract will be created firstly in 

the Lympo portal. The user will sign a contract with the data proxy company to share the 

information. The components for the smart contract are similar to the previously detailed 

reward program:

Account of the person/company which is creating a contract

Account of the end user who will receive the rewards, after authorizing the access

The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be transferred as a reward

The detailed description of the agreement: which data will be used, who will get access to it, 

etc. This information will be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the 

smart contract. 

The creator of the smart contract will use all the parameters above and will sign the call to 

blockchain with his/her password. The smart contract will lock the reward tokens. After the 

user inside the Lympo platform gives the authorization to access the data, Lympo core will 

check if all conditions detailed in the agreement are met. If everything is correct, Lympo core 

will invoke the call to a smart contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens to the user. The 

data proxy company will be able to access the user data by using Lympo API and Data Access 

Engine component. 

SYSTEM ACTORS

The ecosystem is built around an active and dynamic community. These people care about their 

health or are providing services in the fitness/wellness domain. The community also includes 

research and insurance companies who can use the data collected by system users and can 

develop better products, analyse trends and encourage the healthy lifestyle. 

Every system participant will need to have an account in the Ethereum blockchain and account 

in Lympo platform. The Ethereum account’s public key will be linked to the Lympo account in 

order to collect Lympo tokens, participate in reward programs or other smart contracts. The 

private key will remain in full control by the user and will not be visible to the Lympo platform. 

 

The main actors analysed in the ecosystem:



23

USERS: DATA OWNERS

Users who want to improve their physical condition, and are rewarded for their lifestyle. These 

users will create most of the data inside the system, and will be able to monetize their activities. 

They will be in full control of their data inside the system, and on request will be able to autho-

rize access to the Data Proxy Companies.

TRAINERS/PHYSICIANS/SPORTS INVENTORY MAKERS/GYMS

A big focus of the Lympo portal is to create connections among trainers and the end users. The 

trainers, physicians, sports clubs or even companies who specialize in sports inventory, will find 

users who want to be healthy. The ecosystem will provide features for the trainers to create 

reward programs, and to reward participants using Lympo tokens. Sports club promotions, new 

equipment, innovative devices… everything will find their place in the system. 

DATA PROXY COMPANIES

To o�er more features to the system, the Lympo team will open API to software development 

companies, which can create additional solutions where fitness/wellness data will be used. The 

Data Proxy Companies will not necessary use the data themselves, but will serve as data 

providers for additional actors: Data Processing Companies. The Data Proxy Companies will 

have direct contracts with the end users, and will be required to provide full transparency 

where user data is used.   

DATA PROCESSING COMPANIES

Companies which can use the data for di�erent needs. The data can be used by research 

centres to analyse habits of society and to propose new ideas or programs for health

improvement. Notwithstanding, by having access to user’s data insurance companies could 

provide better service and suggest tailored insurance plans with more convenient pricing 

models. Data Processing Companies can use the Lympo API and have smart contracts with end 

users. However, it’s more likely that professional software houses (Data Proxy Companies) will 

propose simplified interfaces to access the data.

SECURITY MEASURES

The Lympo team is aware that security is a key necessity for its users sharing their healthy 

lifestyle data. Even though this type of data is much less sensitive than medical records and 

thus HIPAA, for example, does not cover fitness and wellness sectors including mobile apps and 

wearables. Lympo is committed to ensure the highest-level security measures mirroring the 

latest developments in cybersecurity best practices.



24

To ensure the confidentiality of the data, or prevent data from unauthorized disclosure, all the 

data in the database will be encrypted with modern encryption algorithm. All communication 

(service to service, service to the client) will be protected by TLS. Access to the database is 

strictly limited to very few to no people, access credentials are managed by a password

manager and rotated in a timely manner, and the access list will be audited in a timely manner 

as well.

To ensure data integrity, the Lympo team will establish a procedure to perform periodic checks 

of data and system functionality to identify integrity issues (e.g., corrupted data, failing hard-

ware, software errors, etc.).

To ensure the availability of data, the database will be backed up periodically, and the backup 

will be verified to be restorable. The Lympo team will also establish a Business Continuity Plan 

(BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to ensure the highest possible availability of Lympo 

services.

The Lympo team will adopt technology with high-security robustness, such as using a HIPAA 

compliant cloud host from cloud service providers such as AWS. In addition, security would be 

built-in early into our software development lifecycle, making sure our technology architecture 

follows security best practices, we audit our system via security experts to find potential issues. 

Additionally, our team is trained with security awareness in mind.

Furthermore, a private bug-bounty programme for white-hat hackers will be set up to receive 

support from top white-hat security researchers globally.
