Be the power

ICO WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.8



ABSTRACT 
60% of the world’s population lives in Asia and almost 
half of this population live in cities; and they’re all 
connected to central power grids. Japan liberalised 
its power grid in 2016, China has done so in parts and 
Singapore will be the first in Southeast-Asia. As more 
countries liberalise their electricity markets, consumers 
will get greater choice in choosing their electricity 
retailers and the way they want to consume energy.

Annual energy expenditure in Asia is expected to 
grow from US$700 billion to US$1.6 trillion, by 2035. 

Source: Asian Development Bank 

In these liberalised environments consumers still 
consume power from centralised grids managed by 
corporatised grid operators. There’s also fast growing 
demand for alternative energy resources like solar 
panels, biomass and wind.

However centralised electricity systems are lagging in 
innovations and alternatives. Solutions like renewable 
energy and peer-to-peer energy trading are still not 
prevalent. Without access to alternatives, consumers 
are not getting the choices they deserve.

ELECTRIFY will enable the decentralisation of power 
production and bring the power of choice to the 
consumer. We aim to build a better electricity network, 
and it starts with an intelligent energy ecosystem.

At the heart of this new ecosystem will be energy smart 
contracts secured on the blockchain, fueled by the 
ELEC token.

LACK OF 
TRANSPARENCY

The lack of transparency between 
electricity contracts means 
customers may not always be 
clear about retail energy prices, 
the sources of energy and the 
carbon footprint.

BARRIERS TO 
CLEAN ENERGY

In a centralised grid infrastructure, 
there is no framework for a reliable 
peer-to-peer trading platform, 
making it difficult for renewable 
generator owners to buy or sell 
power 

CONSUMER 
CREDIT RISK

Without a decentralised trustless 
credit database and payment 
platform, retailers are unable to 
filter out customers with a poor 
credit history, resulting in higher 
costs for all consumers.

RETAIL ELECTRICITY MARKETPLACE
Founded by two senior executives from the Singaporean energy industry in early 2017, 
ELECTRIFY is the first retail electricity marketplace in Southeast-Asia addressing the 
need for transparency and security in the energy market. With a GMV of over SGD$5 
million to date, ELECTRIFY has transacted more than 30GWh of electricity for business 
consumers since incorporation.

The ELECTRIFY ecosystem will operate as the consumer-facing, 
ELECTRIFY Marketplace 2.0, driven by smart-contracts and a 
peer-to-peer energy trading platform, Synergy.
ELECTRIFY’s existing marketplace business model will be transformed into the 
ELECTRIFY Marketplace 2.0, ensuring a legitimate use case for the ELEC token. With 
the upcoming liberalisation of the energy market across Asia, Marketplace 2.0 will be 
enhanced to host retail electricity smart contracts and provide homeowners an avenue 
to browse and purchase electricity from a retailer or a small-scale energy producers.

Synergy, a P2P platform hosted within Marketplace 2.0, will connect many small-scale 
energy producers and consumers, ensure price certainty and cut out the middleman. 
Synergy will allow the ELECTRIFY to rapidly expand into other geographies, using the 
P2P platform to promote an active energy ecosystem.



ELECTRIFY ICO WHITEPAPER v1.8      Page 4 of 15

ELECTRIFY’s new Marketplace 2.0 will be the overarching web and mobile platform, 
allowing consumers to access all of ELECTRIFY’s services. Consumers will be able to 
purchase energy from electricity retailers or directly from their peers (P2P), cutting out 
the middleman. Using smart contracts and blockchain, we bring the following benefits 
to the consumer:

Synergy allows consumers to buy 
power directly from small-scale

rooftop solar and wind turbines.

Synergy removes the middleman, 
and reduces energy costs for all 
consumers.

P2P trades will ride on a Contract 
for Difference (CfD) settlement 
mechanism. 

Beyond microgrids, our CfD-based 
platform will allow Synergy to 
plug-and-play into major cities and 
all developed power grids globally.

POWERPOD & 
eWALLET

eWALLET
The eWallet wil be used to facilitate payments via the 
smart contracts, allowing consumers to pay for their 
energy usage. This will enable automatic and secure 
payments and allow energy suppliers to manage their 
credit risk.

This will be the standard for payments in Marketplace 2.0 
and Synergy.

POWERPOD
To accurately track and audit the production 
from a small-scale energy producer, we have 
developed an IoT smart device to measure 
and enable P2P trades via Synergy smart 
contracts. PowerPod will log the energy 
produced onto a blockchain. 

Producers will be required to deposit at 
least 200 ELEC/kWp of rated generation 
capability as permissioned access to write 
energy data onto the blockchain. This 
encourages long term ownership and 
disincentivises tampering and dishonest 
behaviour.

This data will also allow producers to be 
awarded with a renewable energy certificate.

OPPORTUNITIES

As countries around Asia gear up for the liberalisation of their electricity markets, 
ELECTRIFY will deliver value through our marketplace and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. 
Singapore’s Open Electricity Market liberalisation in 2018 will be an excellent test bed 
for our solutions. 

“Global power demand will grow 
by 58% between now and 2040”.

DISCLAIMERS
IMPORTANT NOTICES
The ELEC tokens are not securities as defined under Singapore’s 
Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) (“SFA”). Accordingly, the SFA 
does not apply to the issuance of the ELEC tokens. For the avoidance 
of doubt, the offering of ELEC tokens need not be accompanied by any 
prospectus or profile statement and no prospectus or profile statement 
needs to be lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”).

This White Paper does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to 
purchase, the ELEC tokens in any jurisdiction in which such offer or 
sale would be unlawful. No regulatory authority in Singapore, including 
the MAS, has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the ELEC tokens 
or this White Paper. This White Paper and any part hereof may not be 
distributed or otherwise disseminated in any jurisdiction where offering 
tokens in the manner set out this White Paper is regulated or prohibited.

The information in this White Paper is current only as of the date on 
the cover hereof. For any time after the cover date of this White Paper, 
the information, including information concerning Electrify’s business 
operations and financial condition may have changed. Neither the 
delivery of this White Paper nor any sale made in the related token 
offering shall, under any circumstances, constitute a representation that 
no such changes have occurred. Electrify does not make or purport to 
make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty, undertaking, 
or other assurance in any form whatsoever to any person, including any 
representations, warranties, undertakings, or other assurances in relation 
to the truth, accuracy, or completeness of any part of the information in 
this White Paper.

Whether taken as a whole or read in part, this White Paper is not, and 
should not be regarded as, any form of legal, financial, tax, or other 
professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice 
before making your own decision as to whether or not to receive 
any ELEC tokens. You are responsible for any and all evaluations, 
assessments, and decisions you make in relation to investing in the ELEC 
tokens. You may request for additional information from Electrify in 
relation to this offer of the ELEC tokens. Electrify may, but is not obliged 
to, disclose such information depending on whether (i) it is legal to do so 
and (ii) the requested information is reasonably necessary to verify the 
information contained in this White Paper.

Electrify is not responsible for compelling any person to accept ELEC 
tokens and disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all liability for 
any adverse consequences arising out of or in relation to such rejections 
of the ELEC tokens.

Upon receiving any ELEC tokens, you will be deemed to have reviewed 
this White Paper (and any information requested and obtained from 
Electrify) in full and to have agreed to the terms of this offering of the 
ELEC tokens, including to the fact that this offering does not fall within 
the scope of any securities laws in Singapore and is not regulated by the 
MAS. You further acknowledge and agree that the ELEC tokens are not 
securities and are not meant to generate any form of investment return.

The ELEC tokens and related services provided by Electrify (if any) 
are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Electrify does not 
grant any warranties or make any representation, express or implied or 
otherwise, as to the accessibility, quality, suitability, accuracy, adequacy, 
or completeness of the ELEC tokens or any related services provided 
by Electrify, and expressly disclaims any liability for errors, delays, or 
omissions in, or for any action taken in reliance on, the ELEC tokens 
and related services provided by Electrify. No warranty, including the 
warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, 
satisfactory quality, or fitness for a particular purpose, is given in 
conjunction with the ELEC tokens and any related services provided by 
Electrify.

RISK FACTORS
REGULATORY RISKS
The regulation of tokens such as the ELEC tokens is still in a very nascent 
stage of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to 
how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated exists. The 
applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to 
the date of issuance of this White Paper. Such change may be very rapid 
and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature 
of such regulatory evolution. Electrify does not, in any way, represent 
that the regulatory status of the ELEC tokens will remain unaffected by 
any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and 
after this offering.

NO REGULATORY SUPERVISION
None of Electrify or its affiliates is currently regulated or subject to 
the supervision of any regulatory body in Singapore. In particular, 
Electrify and its affiliates are not registered with MAS in Singapore as 
any type of regulated financial institution or financial advisor and are 
not subject to the standards imposed upon such persons under the 
Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisors Act, and other related 
regulatory instruments. Such persons are required to comply with a 
variety of requirements and standards concerning disclosures, reporting, 
compliance, and conduct of their operations for purposes or maximising 
investor protections. Since Electrify is not subject to such requirements 
or standards, it will make decisions on those issues at its own discretion. 
While Electrify will have regard to best practices on these issues, holders 
of ELEC tokens may not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree 
of investor protections as would be the case should they invest with 
regulated entities instead.

NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES OWED
As Electrify is not a regulated financial institution, it does not owe 
investors in ELEC tokens any fiduciary duties. This means that Electrify 
has no legal obligation to always act in good faith in the best interests of 
holders of ELEC tokens. While Electrify will have regard to the interests 
of holders of ELEC tokens, it is also permitted to consider the interests 
of other key stakeholders and to prefer these interests over the interests 
of ELEC token holders. This may mean that Electrify is permitted to 
make decisions that conflict with the interests of ELEC token holders. 
Not owing any fiduciary duties to holders of ELEC tokens also means 
that holders of ELEC tokens may have limited rights of recourse against 
Electrify and its affiliates in the event of disputes.

TAX RISKS
The tax characterization of ELEC tokens is unclear. Accordingly, the tax 
treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who 
wish to receive ELEC tokens should seek independent tax advice prior to 
deciding whether to receive any ELEC tokens. Electrify does not make 
any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from 
purchasing or holding ELEC tokens.

RISKS FROM THIRD PARTIES
The tokenised nature of ELEC tokens means that they are a blockchain-
based asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of 
blockchain assets depends on factors outside of Electrify’s control, such 
as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in 
this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining attacks, and who has access 
to the smart contract where the ELEC tokens are stored. Electrify is 
unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having 
any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the ELEC tokens. 
Persons intending to receive the ELEC tokens should note that adverse 
events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some 
or all of the ELEC tokens. Such loss may be irreversible. Electrify is not 
responsible for taking steps to retrieve ELEC tokens lost in this manner.

RISKS IN RECEIVING THE ELEC TOKENS
Electrify cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there 
are no risks in relation to the issuance of the ELEC tokens. The ELEC 
tokens may, depending on the manner in which the relevant issuance is 
effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The 
involvement of such parties or platforms may introduce risks that would 
not otherwise be present, such as misconduct or fraud by the third party, 
or your failure to receive the ELEC tokens upon duly making payment 
because of a third-party wallet’s incompatibility with the ELEC tokens. 
Electrify is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of 
third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently losing) 
any or all ELEC tokens issued to you.
