Introduction

The Plutus Mobile Application enables a user to make contactless Bitcoin payments at any merchant
with a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled checkout terminal. This is the most practical way to pay
with Bitcoin, because the payment process consists only of holding a mobile device above the merchants
NFC reader. As a result, Bitcoin payments are effectively accepted by proxy at over 32 million brick and
mortar merchants around the world.

The primary purpose of Plutus is to provide incentive for, and enable, the practical day-to-day usage of
Bitcoin; ultimately accelerating mass-consumer adoption.

The competitive advantage of Plutus, within the mobile payments industry, is the effective utiliza-
tion of the rapidly expanding Ethereum network. Through a transparent and decentralized network
protocol, underwritten by distributed ledger technology (the blockchain), Ethereum allows Plutus to de-
ploy smart contracts to enable secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of fiat currency and Bitcoin, with the
added benefit of automatic escrow. Using these methods, the Plutus Decentralized Exchange Network
(PlutusDEX) of traders convert Bitcoin deposits into a prepaid debit balance that is valid at any contact-
less point-of-sale (POS) terminal.

The philosophy of the application itself is open, inclusive and committed to the network health and
widespread usage of Bitcoin. As such, a public trading API will be available, and 3rd party development
is encouraged.

1 The Ecosystem

Bitcoin merchant adoption has thus far proved to be
a challenging endeavor. Merchants are hesitant to
accept it, and users are unable to spend it. Because
there is no widespread Bitcoin point-of-sale (POS)
infrastructure currently in place, merchants often re-
consider accepting Bitcoin due to its perceived com-
plexity, which may increase labor costs in the short
run, because of the extra employee training required.
In many cases, they stop accepting Bitcoin or become
frustrated with early technical difficulties. These dif-
ficulties often lead to narrowing merchant adoption
of Bitcoin and the blockchain infrastructure in gen-
eral. This creates a kind of chicken-and-the-egg prob-
lem, which contributes to forcing merchant-side Bit-
coin payment processors to significantly limit their
expansion and adoption efforts.

This is the crux of the problem which makes Plutus
an optimal use case and ideal app for miners, en-
trepreneurs, freelancers and anyone else who earns
Bitcoin. By avoiding the need to wait for merchant

adoption, consumers immediately gain both local and
international opportunities for spending the digital
currency at physical locations. The Plutus ecosys-
tem can be seen in Figure 1. The chicken-and-the-
egg problem is solved through both increased user
and merchant adoption, because of Plutus vastly im-
proved ease-of-use, lowered costs, and greater effi-
ciency for merchants, in both the long run and the
short run.

2 Overview & Process

Plutus relies heavily on distributed computing and in-
corporates connections to the Bitcoin and Ethereum
networks, as well as the traditional debit card infras-
tructure. As such, it is a hybrid system with both
centralized and decentralized network components.

The structure of the Plutus Internal Infrastructure
(Figure 2) relies on several interconnected servers
and modules. The mobile app itself connects via Se-
cure Sockets Layer (SSL) end-to-end encryption to

1

the Plutus app server, which in turn communicates
with the other network servers. The Bitcoin track-
ing server reads transaction data contained in the
header of each block broadcast onto the Bitcoin net-
work to confirm when payments have been completed.
Plutons are divisible and tradable assets created on
the Ethereum network. This ensures that all Plutons,
whether they are traded or transacted between users,
are safely confirmed, and permanently stored on the
Ethereum blockchain.

The PlutusDEX, or DEX, is a dApp (decentralized
application) on the Ethereum blockchain which han-
dles Bitcoin and Pluton trading and matches orders.
Traders can register at http://dex.plutus.it to in-
teract with other users on the decentralized exchange
to purchase Bitcoins and Plutons using fiat moneys,
i.e. GBP, USD, or EUR. The dApp parses the data
from each traders price and quantity submitted to
the exchange. The Bitcoin tracking server monitors
the address of each user of the mobile app. As a user
deposits Bitcoins onto their mobile app, the amount
is instantly matched with the best valued offer from a
DEX trader, and the user is sent their rebate reward
in the form of Plutons. The DEX trader sends the
correct amount of fiat currency to the Plutus Escrow,
where it is then relayed to the merchants bank and
completes the transaction cycle, as shown in Figure 3.

1. An app user enters an amount of Bitcoin to de-
posit. The DEX dApp instantly matches the re-
quest with the best price provided by verified
traders on the PlutusDEX platform, along with
the corresponding Bitcoin and/or Pluton payout
address.

1. A Bitcoin or Pluton deposit request is sent to
the DEX dApp running on the Ethereum
blockchain via the Plutus internal server.

2. Offers and bids are matched using the DEX
dApp, resulting in a sale of digital tokens
for fiat currency at the current market rate.
The DEX dApp sends an event message to
the app user containing the public address
of the trader who exchanges the users Bit-
coin for fiat.

2. The DEX dApp receives blockchain transaction
verification via the Plutus tracking server, which
interacts with both the Bitcoin and Ethereum
blockchains. Upon confirmation, the DEX dApp
marks the transaction as complete.

1. A notification is sent to the Plutus Internal
Server.

2. The Plutus internal server (centralized) con-
firms deposits and transaction details on
the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as on
Ethereums blockchain. It then sends the
event message to the DEX dApp (decentral-
ized) running on the Ethereum blockchain.

3. Traders must verify their account and identity on
the PlutusDEX platform to enable any transfer
of funds to the Plutus escrow account. A trader
can then enter trade information (create a bid)
on the DEX dApp. Traders announce their pay-
out wallet address in advance, in order to re-
ceive Bitcoin or Pluton deposits directly from
app users.

1. Traders can use any valid Bitcoin address,
and hold their own private keys. Offline
wallets and cold storage are recommended.

2. Deposits of fiat-currency to Plutus escrow is
completed via the DEX dApp. Details of
all trades and deposits are stored on the
Ethereum blockchain.

4. Next, the Plutus internal server receives verifica-
tions from the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains
of the completed transaction stored within the
DEX dApp. Funds are immediately deducted
from the DEX users escrow account and then re-
leased to the prepaid virtual debit card on the
mobile app in the selected local currency.

1. The Virtual Debit Card (VDC) gateway en-
ables contactless balance creation in GBP,
USD, and EUR.

5. The merchant then receives payment authoriza-
tion via the VDC gateway. Funds in their pre-
ferred currency are forwarded to the merchants
bank through the established worldwide debit
card banking network.

1. Finally, a transaction confirmation is sent to
the app which triggers an update to the
contactless balance for the mobile app user.

2.1 The PlutusDEX Platform

The PlutusDEX platform, illustrated in Figure 4,
consists of two main components:

1. The PlutusDEX dApp that runs on the Ethereum
network.

3

http://dex.plutus.it


Figure 3: The Plutus Payment Network

2. Applications that form a bridge between
Ethereum and the traditional payment in-
frastructure.

The PlutusDEX platform features the utilization of
Ethereum dApps to execute trades between app users
and traders in a peer-to-peer system. The DEX dApp
matches bids for Bitcoin and Plutons. The platform
itself supports fiat deposits and offers traders access
to purchase Bitcoin directly from app users.

2.2 Plutus Mobile App

The Plutus Mobile App (Figure 5) connects users di-
rectly to PlutusDEX traders on the Ethereum net-
work. Using the Plutus internal server, the Bitcoin
network can be reached using the native Bitcoin API,
which is connected to via the Java API (ethereumj),
or alternatively, the Javascript API (web3).

The Plutus Mobile App enables the user to choose
among a selection of different fiat currencies. A vir-
tual debit card account can be created in GBP, USD,
or EUR, allowing the user to have multiple payment
options.

2.2.1 Plutus App Fee Optimization

Bitcoin conversion has a fee of between 1-4% (TBD).
The fee is deducted from the users’ fiat deposit bal-
ance before the money is released to their VDC ac-
count on the Plutus Mobile App. There are no other
fees for using the app and no fee to deposit Plutons on
the app obtained from another user externally. Plu-
tus pays all transaction costs associated with using
the Ethereum network (See Section 2.4.2). Merchants
pay their normal debit card payment processing fees.

2.3 Plutus Payment Process

The Plutus payment process (Figure 6) consists of
two main actions:

1. The Plutus Mobile App initiates a wireless pay-
ment to the merchants NFC-enabled payment
terminal through the user’s NFC-enabled smart-
phone.

2. The users VDC payment authorization is sent to
the merchants payment processor, and once ap-
proved, the funds are deposited to the merchants

bank account. The user and the merchant, re-
spectively, receive confirmation of a successful
transaction.

2.4 Pluton Token Infrastructure

Plutons are the internal digital asset of Plutus and
are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Pluton trans-
actions can be sent and received using the Plutus
Mobile App, similarly to Bitcoin. Plutons have the
added benefit of zero transaction fees, as well as in-
stant transaction confirmations.

Ownership of Plutons is tied to an Ethereum ac-
count. Pluton token source code — running on the
production Ethereum network (networkid 1) — acts
as a decentralized and distributed ledger of all Plu-
ton transactions and the addressed location of every
Pluton. The benefits of using Ethereums blockchain
is its reliability, underwritten by Ethereums built-in
incentives for securing the blockchain. This ensures
the continuity, integrity and security of the Pluton
ledger.

The Ethereum network supports near-instant confir-
mations of Pluton transactions. According to the lat-

est data, the average time for a new transaction to
be confirmed on the blockchain is approximately 17
seconds. This enables users to convert their digital
assets to fiat currency in nearly an instant.

2.4.1 Pluton Rebate System

Plutus Mobile App users are rewarded with a rebate,
at a predetermined rate, of Plutons for every Bitcoin-
to-fiat exchange they make in order to fill their VDC
balance. Plutons can be exchanged for fiat currency
that is then instantly credited to the users contact-
less balance. There is no rebate reward given for ex-
changes of Pluton and fiat currencies.

The Pluton Rebate System (Figure 7) is implemented
on the Ethereum network and regulated by the DEX.
Plutons received as rebate rewards are distributed au-
tomatically by the DEX to Plutus Mobile App users.

There will be 20,000,000 total Plutons in existence.
As the trading begins for Plutons on the DEX net-
work, the exchange rate, EP , will fluctuate according
to market conditions. Its general equation can be
described as the amount of Plutons, Pt, required to

6

Figure 7: The Plutus Rebate System

trade for one Bitcoin, or

EP =
Pt

1BTC
(1)

Bid orders for Plutons are made via the trading fron-
tend. The PlutusDEX trading API will be open
source. It will enable the participation of users on
the DEX network once they have been verified on
the frontend.

Users can buy Plutons, as well as Bitcoin, using the
DEX. Plutons earned via rebates can be transferred
on the blockchain and have no restrictions on use with
in the payment system. Users can transfer Plutons to
other users or trade them for fiat currency, which is
sent to the users VDC balance for in-store purchases.
Plutons are implemented as a Transferable Fungibles
e.g. sub-currency on Ethereum, using the standard
Ethereum API.

Since rebate rewards are only dispersed when con-
verting Bitcoin to fiat money we must utilise the vari-

able exchange rate of, EBTC , Bitcoin to the British
Pounds, expressed as

EBTC =
1BTC

TtGBP
(2)

where Tt represents the current amount of British
Pounds required to purchase one Bitcoin as dictated
by the market.

Let Ti symbolize a single transaction by a single user,
worth no more than a maximum value of £30. Mul-
tiplying Ti by equation (1) yields the Bitcoin value,
Bi, of the given transaction,

Bi = EBTC ∗ Ti (3)

where Ti ≤ £30.

The rebate reward rate, R, changes every 24 hours ac-
cording to the previous days aggregate Bitcoin trans-
action volume, V △, expressed as

V △ =

n∑

i=1

B
△

i (4)

7

https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIS


where the symbol, △, in the superscript indicates
that it represents data from the previous day. The
previous days aggregate Bitcoin transaction volume
is obtained above by summation of each instance of
equation (3) on the previous day.

The rebate reward rate is determined by an algorithm
(Figure 8), where R is a dependent variable to V △ by
adapting and modifying the model of a step function
to a non-Boolean use. The indicator function of R
is defined as the interval expression, IV △ , with the
subscript, V △ , of equation (4), which acts as the
interval parameter function of the next days rebate
reward rate, defined by the expression

R := IV △(R) (5)

The interval parameter function is defined by the
variable values of R, which are dependent on the cor-
responding range of the previous days Bitcoin trans-
action volume, V △.

IV △(R) := {Ri,mi ≤ V
△ ≤ Mi (6)

The rebate rate, Ri, in the above expression repre-
sents the general structure of the parameters that
describe every possible value. Each daily rebate rate,
Ri, must differentiate from the previous days rate,
R△, by ±0.01%, while Mi − mi = 0.1BTC at each
step. The maximum rebate rate is set at 3% when
the daily volume is 5 BTC or less and 1% when the
daily volume is 25 BTC or more. Thus, each daily
increase in volume of 0.1 BTC will reduce the rebate
rate by 0.01%, and vice-versa.

The PlutusDEX dApp calculates the previous 24hr
Bitcoin deposit volume on the network to determine
the rebate amount for the following 24hrs on the app.
This data is relayed to the Pluton issuer code and the
change is affected immediately.

Now that the rebate reward rate, R, has been found
above, we can find the amount of Pluton, Pi, for one
users single transaction by multiplying the results of
equation (1), equation (3), and the current exchange
rate, R△, to find

Pi = EP ∗Bi ∗R
△ (7)

The rebate reward rate has the delta in its superscript
to indicate that it was calculated using the previous
days Bitcoin transaction volume as expressed in equa-
tion (5).

Finally, we can calculate the total Pluton dispersed
to users for an entire day, Pday, by summation of the
results obtained from equation (3) and equation (7)
and simplifying to obtain the emission equation:

Pday = R ∗
n∑

i=1

(Pi ∗Bi) (8)

2.4.2 Smart Contracts & Functionality

On the Ethereum blockchain, dApps are regulated by
their underlying code, commonly called a smart con-
tract. Plutus has several types of interacting contract
code, each with an important function. Each instance
can be called via the internal infrastructure, the Plu-
tus web-application (client side), and/or the Plutus
Mobile App. When an instance is called, the result is
transmitted, asynchronously, as an Ethereum event.

These events will handle all Plutus transactions be-
tween traders and users; will register new deposits
of fiat currency; and will regulate the issuance of
new Pluton tokens, earned by users as rebates. Ev-
ery time a Plutus smart contract is called, a small
amount of Ether must be payed as a transaction
fee for Ethereum miners. This fee is known as the
Gas Price and is paid for by Plutus.

Each instance of a Plutus smart contract is explained
in more detail below. Their interactions are illus-
trated in Figure 9:

• Plutus User Contract : This is created for each
user and each trader who register. Users can
register through the Plutus Mobile App. Due to
Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, users must
identify themselves using the Plutus central ser-
vice, or through an external service such as
Uport. The user contract itself will contain a
limited amount of logic, but it does reference
other smart contracts such as PlutusDEX con-
tract and the Pluton token contract.

• PlutusDEX Contract : Enables users to exchange
Plutons, fiat currency and Bitcoin. Traders
can deposit fiat money using the Plutus central-
ized web-application. After verification by the
Plutus internal infrastructure, users can trade
by directly interacting with the smart contract
through the standard client provided by Plutus,
or by using a custom client.

• Pluton Token Contract : Determines the Pluton
balance of every user on the Pluton network and

uses the standard Ethereum API where appli-
cable. Users can view their balance and create
Pluton transactions using a wallet that supports
the transferable fungibles standard, through the
plutons.sol ABI definition. For example: see
Mist Wallet 0.3.5 (Beta 3) release.

• Plutus Issuer Contract : Regulates the amount
of Plutons issued as rebate rewards for Plutus
users. The contract uses the process detailed in
Section 2.4.1. Rewards are based on the amount
of Bitcoin that a user trades for fiat currency
each day. Only Plutus central can issue rebates.

• Name Registry Contract : Holds the addresses
of all active Plutus smart contracts, and allows
other smart contracts to call it to return spe-
cific addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. See
namereg.sol for example code.

A more detailed overview of Plutus smart contracts
and how they interact can be found in Section
4. Plutus smart contracts are being actively de-
veloped as open source software viewable on the
Plutus Github. Readers are encouraged to comment
or supply patches to the source code.

2.5 Virtual Debit Card Gateway

A DEX trader transfers fiat funds to the Plutus es-
crow account prior to entering trade information.
Only the Plutus virtual debit card gateway applica-
tion can release the fiat balance to a virtual debit card
token. This is a secure token used for authorization,
which is sent to the merchant’s payment processor
via the NFC mobile device. The fiat amount is re-
leased to the merchants bank-account via the debit
card payment network, once the trade has been com-
pleted.

• VDC gateway connects to the Plutus app.

– VDC providers API enables users to gener-
ate a single virtual debit card token for each
selected currency (GBP, USD & EUR).

– A Plutus app account only allows one VDC
account per currency. Each new deposit
will be added to the same VDC account.

• VDC gateway connection to NFC device.

– Plutus app user initiates a purchase cycle,
by contacting the merchants NFC-enabled
POS terminal (contactless card reader).

– The mobile devices built-in NFC capa-
bility is used to send the VDC token-
authorization code to the merchants pay-
ment processor or bank.

3 Trust & Security

The app user preloads his VDC using Bitcoin. The
request is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ren-
dering it transparent and decentralized. This request
is handled by the DEX, which sends the traders pay-
out address to the Plutus Mobile App. The app then
transfers Bitcoin directly to the payout address pro-
vided by the trader.

Since public addresses of traders are published on
blockchains, and therefore known to the Plutus plat-
form, the Plutus platform can verify that the amount
transferred to the traders accounts is correct before
releasing the fiat balance accordingly. The VDC-
provider receives the fiat amount and loads balance
to the customers VDC.

The app is designed for small day to day payments
only. It has a deposit limit for different account types
and a per transaction limit of £30 in the UK (min-
imum transaction limit changes according to loca-
tion). Users will be advised to only deposit what they
wish to spend. In case of user error where the deposit
amount is more or less than the requested amount,
the smart contract will notify Plutus of the anomaly
and fund the users VDC account accordingly.

Note: Traders receiving deposits have verified identi-
ties using KYC/AML procedures and have fiat funds
secured in escrow. There is a minimum balance limit
for traders on the DEX to protect against anomalies
linking to incorrect deposit amounts.
