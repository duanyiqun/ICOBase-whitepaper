“The received wisdom that economic inequality is fated to endure and even get worse 

makes all of us, in a little way, Marxists. But what if the model of organization that Weber 

and his inheritors in economics and sociology found to be the most adapted to competition 

and management in modern life has become obsolete? What if power is dispersing, 

coming to dwell in new forms and through new mechanisms in a host of small and 

previously marginal players, while the power advantage of the big, established, and more 

bureaucratic incumbents decays? The rise of micropowers throws open such questions, 

for the first time. It holds out the prospect that power may have become remarkably 

unmoored from size and scale.”

Isn't What It Used to Be

Executive Summary 

Loyalty is trust. Trust is called a new currency, much like the bitcoin, because the difference in trust 

between a company and its competitor directly translates into how much money each is going to make. 

 

Every year millions of retailers spend in excess of $20 billion on software that improves the loyalty of 

their customers. They need to do that in order to stay competitive in the today’s crowded marketplace. 

 

Loyalty programs are not only costly, but also time consuming and cumbersome to set up. Often times, 

customers get only more frustrated from participation in them, complaining about difficulty to earn points 

or bonuses and to redeem them. This results in the fact that most loyalty programs just don’t pay 

themselves off, and shut down in less than 12 months’ time. 

 

We are a team who has worked together for 5 years in GIFTD, an innovative profitable loyalty SaaS 

company that helps hundreds of small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses to increase their 

revenue by an average of more than 17%. We are building BitRewards as a spinoff from this successful 

business, because blockchain technology allows for introducing a novel approach towards loyalty and 

rewards market, which will create new value for customers, merchants and the community-at-large. 

 

BitRewards is a blockchain loyalty platform and ecosystem that enables retailers to reward their 

customers' purchases, friends' invited and other configurable actions with crypto-currency. It has an 

absolute value for the customers, as they get for their purchases the liquid Ethereum-based tokens, 

which can be redeemed for purchases or transferred to another crypto-wallet. The price of the tokens 

is also set for growth due to our unique business model, so these rewards may go up in value in the 

course of time, rather than expire.  

 

BitRewards also brings a lot of benefits to the retailers, because they get customers that are more 

satisfied with the rewards in crypto and become even more loyal. A comprehensive loyalty program 

increases the retailers’ revenue by dozens of percents. The stores are also tapping into the crypto-

enthusiasts audience, which is quite active and appreciates the attention from the regular businesses.  

 

The unique value proposition for the retailers is that BitRewards will offer this valuable and expensive 

loyalty technology free of charge. The retailers will only have to buy BIT in the open market to reward 

their users. The value of such software starts from $200/month, therefore thousands of retailers will be 

keen to connect to the platform. We can make such a claim, because we operate in the market of 

rewards and loyalty software for more than 5 years, have more than five hundred clients - online stores 

and deeply know their needs. BitRewards also uses AI-based predictive analytics, which allows to 



 6 

configure the rewards and actions for each particular business to address its unique target audience 

and achieve the highest return on investment from every dollar spent on the rewards. 

 

BitRewards is compatible with most existing e-commerce systems (Magento, Shopify, WordPress, 

Ecwid, etc.). It is easy to integrate and has a simple API. 

 

Tokens — BIT     
Internal BitRewards tokens are called BIT and comply with the ERC20 standard. BIT is an internal 

currency and is used to conduct all operations within the BitRewards ecosystem.  

Customers of the online stores participating in BitRewards Network will receive BIT as a cash-back — 

a certain configurable amount or percent on their purchases, purchases of the friends that they referred 

to the store, shares and likes in social networks and other actions. The cash-back will be credited to 

the customer’s automatically created crypto-wallet connected to the store via BitRewards plugin. 

BIT can be redeemed at the same store or with the other BitRewards participating merchants via an 

online crypto-wallet connected to the participating merchants. Customer crypto-wallet’s BIT balance 

may also be connected to the bank debit card, which the users can spend just as if they used their 

regular Visa or Mastercard. The customers will appreciate the opportunity, because they get a liquid 

crypto-currency, instead of loyalty points.  

The customers can also buy BIT on the open market (e.g. exchanges, etc.) or via the Bancor liquidity 

smart contract. 

The private key to a token holder’s BIT can be stored on the wallet provided by the BitRewards network 

platform, on the standard Ethereum wallet, or on any wallet supporting the ERC20.  

The value of the BitRewards token will be determined on the open market, but only after the listing 

formalities are completed and the tokens are allowed to be listed on the trading platforms. In most 

exchanges tokens can be converted into ETH, Bitcoin or fiat. The token is accepted by all merchants 

that use the loyalty platform and other partners of BitRewards Network. 

The demand for the BIT tokens most likely will grow because of the limited initial issuance of 2 billion 

tokens and the increasing number of retailers joining the platform exceeding the supply from the 

customers who redeem the tokens for purchases or trade them at the open market, which will create 

an ascending path of least resistance.

Market overview 

Preface   

BitRewards is designed for all types of retailers, but our sweet spot is e-commerce because they readily 

adopt such services and are easy to scale. The e-commerce market has grown consistently every year, 

and, according to Statista data, the market will increase more than 70% in the US over the next five 

years (from $360 billion in 2016 to $638 billion in 2022). 

 

The rapid growth of e-commerce, the automation of purchase processes and delivery have made this 

market extremely competitive. Today customers are more price sensitive, expect more from brands, 

and compare prices on a regular basis. Customer loyalty, measured in repeat purchases and referrals, 

is the key driver of profitability for online businesses, even more so than for offline companies, according 

to a series of joint studies in online retail by Bain & Company. 

 

User acquisition today is one of the most costly activities of any retailer. Statistics say that the average 

conversion of traffic into purchases in e-commerce comes to 3%, however the real figures are 1% and 

less. And it is clear why: our attention span today is 8 seconds - less than that of a goldfish. Businesses 

spend an increasing amount of resources wrestling for customers’ attention, and this is only half the 



 8 

task: they also have to retain their attention. Studies show that acquiring a new customer is anywhere 

from 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. And customers are also easily 

switching brands, particularly when the competition is a click away. So retailers must invest in their 

customers’ loyalty. Lots of data shows that loyal customers stay longer, buy more and more often, cost 

less to process, help in price competition, tell their friends about their experiences, and provide valuable 

feedback.  

Loyalty management market 

Loyalty systems in retail are designed to reward customers for their past purchases or other useful 

actions and to provide them with incentives for making future purchases. A rewards program enables 

activation, retention, up-selling and referrals, along with providing strong value offer to the customer. A 

typical loyalty management system is comprised of operational parameters, such as transaction types, 

program design and funding options. It further includes value parameters such as redemption options, 

redemption thresholds, and earnings rates. 

 

And businesses are actively adopting loyalty programs: 

 63.7% of small businesses plan on using a customer loyalty program in 2016 (Belly) 

 38% of executives have a dedicated budget for customer experience (Leapfrog Marketing 

Institute) 

 

The market for loyalty programs is growing and will reach $4 billion by 2020 ("Loyalty Management 

Market” report by MarketsAndMarkets). There’s approximately another $1 billion in digital gift cards, 

and at least $11 billion in referral solutions. On top of that, more than $50 billion loyalty points are issued 

globally each year. According to a Deloitte report, enrollment in loyalty programs across various 

industries reached 3.3 billion memberships in 2015 and has more than tripled since 2000. Despite this 

rapid growth, customer loyalty rewards programs are not realizing their full potential. 

  

According to the 2016 Bond Loyalty Report, North American consumers belong to 13.4 loyalty programs 

on average, but are only active in about half of those. Moreover, only 44 percent of consumers said 

they are “very satisfied” with the loyalty program experiences. 

Key problems for loyalty and rewards solutions  

Encouraging loyalty is not an easy game. A lot of customer issues can result in problems for loyalty 

rewards providers, including:

Account inactivity 

With many loyalty programs, the need to take additional action and non-transparent reward schemes 

are perceived negatively by customers and lead to adoption decrease and customer inactivity. 

According to 3Cinteractive, 70% of consumers do not sign up for a loyalty program due to the 

inconvenience and time required to complete registration. 

Low redemption rates 

According to The 2016 Bond Loyalty Report, the percentage of customers who were active members 

was only at 50 percent. Out of these members, 20% never redeemed their received bonuses and 

rewards. Also, according to this report, loyalty and rewards program members who do not make 

redemptions are 2.3 times more likely to defect from one program and join another.

Low client retention 

Existing loyalty programs give insufficient motivation to encourage repeat purchases. According to 

COLLOQUY “Customer loyalty 2015 & beyond report”, the top two reasons why consumers stop 

participating in a loyalty program are: the program did not provide offers that were of interest (56%), 

and it was too hard to earn points for rewards (54%).

Increased costs for customer service 

Retailers who want to set up their own in-house loyalty program, need to not only invest time, money 

and effort, but to also arrange a solid customer support service specifically aimed at the loyalty program, 

which incurs training and sometimes hiring employees, the implementation of internal practices and 

procedures, reporting, and analysis. The more sophisticated the loyalty program rules are, the higher 

the cost of customer service. 

 

Low motivation by offered rewards 

According to CardLinx’s 2016 Card-Linking Industry Survey, 64% of consumers prefer cash-back 

payments as part of rewards, while only 12% prefer programs connected with the accumulation of 

bonuses, points or miles.  

 

 

At the same time, loyalty programs are still one of the most effective solutions to generate more revenue 

among existing customers. According to the Talech Retail Technology Report, 87% of customers say 

they want loyalty programs. 

 

The outlined problems could be solved by an integrated loyalty system, which would provide customers 

with convenient tools to earn rewards and redeem them for valuable purchases. 

 

With the emergence of blockchain technology, creating such a system has become possible. Our 

hypothesis that the new approach to rewards and loyalty with the use of blockchain and smart contracts 



 11 

can deliver synergy, is confirmed by recent blockchain experiments of Deloitte, IBM, China Union Pay, 

MasterCard, VISA and many more.  

 

 

Value proposition 

BitRewards is a B2B2C rewards and loyalty solution built using blockchain and smart contract 

technology. The platform enables merchants to reward shoppers with BitRewards tokens (BIT, an 

ERC20 token) for their and their friends’ purchases and other valuable actions with configurable 

rewards. AI-based analytics allows for setting up and adjusting the rewards in order to achieve the best 

conversion rates and loyalty, which results in increased sales. The decentralized rewards management 

on blockchain makes the platform unique and delivers great value to all platform members and their 

customers:  

- for the retailers – a premium blockchain loyalty management system with a value of $200-$2000 per 

month for free. 

- for the customers – cryptocurrency rewards, which they can turn into real money or redeem for 

purchases and which do not expire and tend to go up in price. 

 

Our platform provides the necessary infrastructure for the loyalty management system: modules or 

plug-ins for all popular online trading platforms (OpenCart, Shopify, WordPress, Magento, etc.), mobile 

wallets for customers, mobile apps, and extensions for browsers (Chrome, Firefox).  

Since BitRewards is a decentralized system, its solutions are easily scalable and have no geographical 

or platform limitations or restrictions. In fact, the plug-in can be downloaded from the app stores of e-

commerce platforms and website builders and any retailer can be connected to BitRewards in only a 

matter of a few minutes. 

How does BitRewards solve the main problems of loyalty 
systems? 

Account inactivity 

BitRewards consolidates retailers in the integrated open-loop loyalty system and provides a simple 

and convenient user interface with a customer-centric approach. Every individual user will have a 

single wallet, accessible from the website of any participating merchant, or from a web or mobile app. 

There is no need to register in a standalone loyalty program of each retailer, and the acquired tokens 

can be redeemed with any other network member.  



 12 

 

Customer-centric approach in BitRewards Network 
 

Low redemption rates 

Unlike the existing loyalty systems that give points, BitRewards transfers value into tokens and credits 

them directly to the customer’s wallet. The value of the rewards denominated in crypto-currency is 

poised to go up along with the growth of the crypto-economy and the market share of the blockchain 

based services and infrastructure, which will make customers want to spend their tokens for additional 

purchases. The users will also be receiving regular reports and offers from the stores where they made 

their purchases, which will also serve to incentivize further actions. 

Increased costs for customer service 

Merchants can use the BitRewards platform for free.  It can be easily installed, and set up and does not 

require any special technical knowledge or skills. 

The workflow around receiving and spending BitRewards tokens will be standard for all participating 

customers, and questions will be handled by the BitRewards service operator, who provides technical 

guidance, support and quality assurance.  

Low motivation by offered rewards 

Customers will perceive the received crypto-currency as being “for free”. It will spur their additional 

interest in cryptocurrencies and initiate demand for valuable rewards from the places they will shop at. 

 

 



 13 

BitRewards benefits 

New customer experience 

The BitRewards decentralized loyalty system creates a unique, user-friendly customer experience: 

 The regular customer’s dashboard with loyalty points turns into a full-fledged crypto-wallet linked 

to hundreds of merchants. Creation requires only a simple registration with a Facebook account, 

email or phone number. It can be used as a regular wallet for the storing of BitRewards crypto-

currency, as well as other currencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.), growing in value of the received 

rewards (connected with the growth of token). 

 The bonuses in the form of BIT from different merchants are accumulated in one customer’s 

account, which is connected to the entire BitRewards Network. 

 The tokens can be redeemed with any merchant within the BitRewards Network and the network’s 

partners that can promote their business with additional bonuses and discounts for the BIT token 

holders. 

 Customer crypto-wallet’s BIT balance will also be connected to the bank debit plastic or virtual 

card, which the users can spend just as if they used their regular Visa or Mastercard. 

 Maximum flexibility and security of the rewards: tokens unlike points don’t expire; they can’t get 

lost, or cease to exist if the merchant goes out of business. 

 An easy way to make purchases in cryptocurrency: Ethereum and Bitcoin can be credited to the 

customer’s BitRewards account and be used as payment with BitRewards’ participating merchants. 

 The token’s value is set for appreciation due to an increasing demand from retailers and the general 

prevailing bull market nature of crypto-markets right now. 

Advantages to retailers 

The retailers connected to the BitRewards Network acquire new marketing tools and increase customer 

loyalty: 

 Free, but powerful and flexible loyalty program for any retailer, brand or service. 

 Unique opportunity to reward customers and pander to cryptocurrency enthusiasts wants. 

 Great chance to stand out among competition and promote a brand or a store. 

 Outstanding value for the customers: BitReward’s business model suggests constant appreciation 

of BIT. (When customers hold BIT received as a reward from a store, they may see their value go 

up over the course of time). 

 Seamless convert of BIT into Bitcoin, Ether and any other cryptocurrency right in the user’s wallet 

on merchants’ websites, or on any other wallet or exchange. 

 Amazing incentive for customers when their reward amount grows, enabling the merchants to 

communicate good news and attract a lot of repeat business. 



 14 

 Cross-redemption of BIT: users can redeem BitRewards Tokens with member merchants, or any 

other participating operator. Something, which will make them feel valued much more than when 

receiving standard points. 

Platform, ecosystem and community 

All merchants get access to the AI data analysis system. We call this BitRecommendations, which 

automatically recommends actions and rewards, which aimed at offering the customers various actions 

and rewards that are incentivizing the most productive behaviour of the customers for every particular 

merchant. 

The BitRewards Network is an ecosystem, which is beneficial to all participants, including customers 

and retailers. Each retailer connected to the network increases both their value, and the overall value 

of the network.  

The ecosystem participants benefit from significantly cutting down their expenses on loyalty 

management. They also get access to a top-notch rewards and loyalty system free of charge, 

something which was previously only affordable for large players. 

BitRewards promotes members of its community in every possible way: by exchanging the best 

practices, by using the platform, for starting advertising campaigns, and by developing new applications. 

The BitRewards community will not only promote the rapid growth of participating businesses, but also 

give a voice to its members on the future direction of the platform. 

  

How it works 

1. The retailers connect to the BitRewards loyalty system by installing the readymade GIFTD 

extension or by integrating it with their own loyalty system. 

2. This solution rewards customers with BIT for their and their friends’ purchases as well as other 

actions. The module performs all the required token processing through the BitRewards platform. 

3. The value of BIT may appreciate because of the limited initial issuance of 2 billion tokens and the 

constant leading demand for tokens from the growing number of retailers joining the platform. 

4. The probable appreciation of BIT encourages customers to save their tokens instead of redeeming 

them for purchases, thereby also reducing the amount of free-floating tokens. 

 

 

 



 15 

How customers earn BIT. User experience. 

The following workflow illustrates the simple steps users will need to take in order to earn BitRewards 

Tokens by completing their purchase at the BitRewards Network’s member merchant.  

 
1. A customer makes a purchase in an online store, which is connected to the BitRewards module 
and sees the reward they can earn for every item they buy in the store. 
 

 

 



 16 

2. They register through a social network, email or phone.  
 

 

 
3. The customer sees confirmation of their BIT reward after the completion of their purchase. 
 

 

 



 17 

4. They also have easy access to the their wallet via the online store’s website. 
 

 

5. Each customer registered in the loyalty system of the BitRewards Network on the retailer's website 

automatically receives a cryptowallet with a unique Ethereum-address. This can in turn be used for 

the receiving and sending of Ether and/or any other ERC20 tokens, while serving as a payment for 

goods or services of this or any other retailer within the BitRewards Network. 

 

 

 



 18 

6. If needed, tokens can be sent to any Ethereum compatible wallet. 

 

 

7. A confirmation message regarding the successful transfer of BIT is shown on the screen and sent to 

the user’s email, if provided. 

 

 



 19 

Steps to redeem 

BitRewards Tokens are also easy to redeem. A customer will just need to note how many BIT he or 

she wants to spend on the purchase, and the order amount will be reduced, depending on the current 

market rate of BIT. A special smart contract will be introduced which will serve as a middleware between 

the shop and customer in this scenario. It will hold the customer’s BIT until a full fiat currency payment 

is received, then it will transfer the BIT to the shop. If the full payment is not received in a certain time 

period, it will transfer the BIT back to the customer and notify the shop about this event. 

If the customer wants to top up the BIT in his BitRewards Network, he can transfer Ether or any ERC-

20 tokens from his Ethereum wallet to his BitRewards Wallet and then use a Liquidity smart contract to 

convert Ether or tokens to BIT. 

 

 

Steps to redeem BitReward Tokens for purchases: 

 

The wallet with BIT is seamlessly integrated into the merchant’s online store, and customers can choose 

what amount of BIT they want to redeem for their purchases. 

 

 

 



 20 

The wallet is easily accessible from any merchant’s website. 

 

 

 

Retailers’ workflow 

The retailers can interact with the BitRewards system in two ways: 

Via BitRewards Operator, which carries out all necessary operations and administers the sales and 

purchases of tokens. Working through the operator, retailers have the opportunity to make payments 

in cryptocurrency and conduct settlements in fiat currencies. The accounting and financial documents, 

if necessary, will be provided by the operator. 

Buy the BitRewards tokens directly on the open market, or through a Smart Contract that maintains the 

liquidity of the BIT in the market. 

Option 1. Working with the system through the BitRewards operator 

Since a lot of retailers are not quite ready to work with cryptocurrency exchanges directly, operations 

will be handled through the BitRewards’ operator company. It will provide the retailers with the ability to 

transact in cryptocurrency and use the platform’s loyalty features with the view towards enabling them 

to use distributed ledger technologies to improve their products and to promote the adoption of 

BitRewards tokens. The operator will offer extended support, design new tools for the retail industry, 

and provide legal, tax and accounting counseling to the clients. 



 21 

 

Mechanics of rewards payment through the BitRewards operator 

 

1. After a customer makes a purchase with their BitRewards tokens, the BitRewards plug-in installed 

by the retailer sends the BitRewards operator an inquiry, “Rewards Request”. The inquiry also 

contains the e-mail address of the customer (or other ID), or their wallet address. 

2. If the BitRewards operator receives the wallet address, the system transfers the tokens from its 

stock to this wallet. If the address is unknown, the operator creates a new account, transfers the 

tokens there, and the customer receives a notification with the details of the created wallet. Using 

the link, the customer installs the web or mobile BitRewards Wallet, and can transact with it, or 

choose to transfer their tokens to their other wallet. 

3. After the completion of the operation, the BitRewards Network operator produces a bill in fiat 

currency in the address of the retailer for the amount which the operator spent on the transaction. 

Payments for purchases through the BitRewards operator: 

1. In the event a customer makes a purchase in full, or in part, using BitRewards tokens, the retailer 

sends a request through API for the sale of the BitRewards tokens. 

2. In response to the request, the BitRewards Network operator returns the wallet account number 

and the amount in fiat currency, which will be paid for the given amount of tokens. 

3. After receiving the tokens, the operator transfers the fiat money to the retailer. 

 

Using the current infrastructure of Ethereum, the transaction processing can take up to 1 minute. After 

the release of the Raiden Network and Lightning Network protocols, the transaction will be settled in a 

matter of seconds. 



 22 

Maintenance of fiat and cryptocurrencies reserves at the BitRewards 
operator 

1. The BitRewards operator needs to maintain a minimum reserve of BIT, fiat currencies, and ETH 

tokens and will convert the collected during ICO cryptocurrencies into fiat at its own discretion, if 

required for the performance of the BitRewards Network project. 

2. To prevent any sharp fluctuations of the BIT’ tokens rate, a liquidity smart contract will be created 

on the basis of Bancor.Formula.  

3. For the maintenance of the necessary level of BIT reserve, the BitRewards operator buys or sells 

BIT at the open market, or through the liquidity smart contract.  

4. For the maintenance of the necessary level of fiat currencies or ETH, the BitRewards Network 

operator at its own discretion buys or sells fiat currencies at the open market for BIT. 

 

Option 2. Direct transactions 

 

BitRewards is a decentralized system. Retailers can make operations with the purchase and sale of 

BIT independently, without the BitRewards operator. 

 

1. The retailer creates its crypto-wallet designed for the payment of rewards and the receiving of 

tokens for purchases from the customer. 

2. The retailer makes all necessary transactions of purchases and sales of tokens and fiat currency 

on the open market, and/or with the liquidity smart contract provided by BitRewards Network.

Liquidity smart contract 

BitRewards Tokens are designed to appreciate over the course of time. Crypto assets markets can be 

volatile, and the market price of BIT can depend on the general market conditions and expectations. 

Since BIT’ main purpose is the means of payment, it is important that the token’s rate against crypto or 

fiat currencies does not change rapidly and has liquidity at all times. In order to provide for this liquidity 

and mollify the market fluctuations, a Bancor Formula (a product of Bprotocol Foundation1) based smart 

contract will be created. It will allow for the buying and selling of BIT and will also be used to increase 

the market demand and supply when the token rate fluctuations leave a certain corridor.  

 

The special liquidity smart contract will hold a reserve of tokens of the BitRewards system and means. 

Anyone will be able to buy or sell BIT simply by sending ETH to the contract’s address. This solution is 

able to provide for the liquidity of tokens and solves the problem of a "double coincidence of wants", 

when a buyer and a seller have to match the time and place for the transaction to occur. A liquidity 

smart contract always acts, as one of the parties either selling or buying. 

 

The contract also abides by efficient market rules: upon the selling of the asset, the price goes down, 

and upon the buying of the asset, the price goes up, therefore the liquidity smart contract changes the 

market price of the asset, available to the transaction, depending on the transaction’s amount. 

 

Therefore, the liquidity for any party interested in buying or selling BIT will be provided for at all times.

Product architecture 

 
 

Retailers 

Plugins for online shopping platforms 

Plugins for online shopping platforms are widgets, which can be set up as the loyalty program of the 

retailer, and to pay BitRewards as rebates to customers as rewards for their and their friends’ 

purchases. The system of rewards and loyalty is based on the suite of solutions of GIFTD, which are 

widely applied in e-commerce: 

1. A “cart protection” tool: incentivizes the completion purchases, which increases the amount 

customers spend and reduces the amount of abandoned orders 

2. A referral system integrated with social networks 

3. Net promoter score calculator and Customer’s reviews module 

4. Digital gift cards solutions, which enables customers to send gift cards via email, SMS, Facebook, 

etc. 

5. Points-based loyalty system: Customers earn points for their actions and retailers can define which 

of the points they put into the BitRewards Tokens and at what rate. 

 

These solutions will be transferred on the distributed ledger and will be supplied for free to all members 

of BitRewards. It will include API for integration of the existing loyalty programs of retailers. 



 25 

Merchant’s dashboard 

A merchant’s dashboard is set up when creating the loyalty program. This allows merchants to define 

the actions and amount of the rewards earned for the completion of each purchase, including the 

percentage of the purchase returned to customers for their and their referrals’ purchases. 

Retailer’s crypto-wallet 

The retailer does not necessarily need to create the BitRewards crypto-wallet, as the transactions can 

pass through the BitRewards Operator using fiat currencies.  

 

Retailers can store their BIT, ETH and other cryptocurrencies, which they use for transactions and pay 

for BIT from this wallet. 

 

The retailer’s cryptowallet will be an open-source software, which is installed on the retailer’s servers. 

For convenience, the Docker image, which contains all necessary settings, will be created. 

 

For maximum security, the private key for the retailer’s crypto-wallet will reside at the retailer’s servers. 

The less secure, but simpler way is to use BitRewards API that stores the keys. 

 

If needed, the retailer can open two crypto-wallets — cold (for large amounts) and hot (for current 

transactions). The "cold" wallet should be shielded from online connection and managed manually. The 

"hot" wallet should be connected to the other software of the retailer (CMS, accounting software, etc.) 

through a private API. 

Auxiliary parts of the system: 

 Mobile SDK for the integration of the BitRewards crypto-wallet into the merchant’s apps. 

 Triggered notifications system (email, SMS, push, messengers). 

 Corporate personnel loyalty system. 

 

 

  



 26 

Customers 

Customer’s loyalty program dashboard with integrated cryptowallet and 
access to the merchants’ websites 

 Customers receive notification of BIT awarded to them at the merchant’s website or their preferred 

notification method 

 

They can sign up or login to the loyalty program via Facebook and other social networks, email or 

phone, and receive immediate access to the cryptowallet in which they can see the BIT that have been 

added. The customers can access the wallet via the website of any BitRewards Network merchant, 

from the BitRewards website, extensions for Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari or a mobile app. 

 

The BitRewards wallet allows the customers to pay with cryptocurrency for purchases from any retailer 

on the BitRewards Network.  

 

The cryptowallet will give a unique Ethereum-address to the customer. It will allow the storing, 

acceptance and sending of BIT, ETH and any other ERC20 tokens. It will be an entry point to the world 

of cryptocurrencies for many people. Other cryptocurrency types will be added at the later stages. 

 

If the BIT amount equivalent exceeds $50 on the customer’s wallet, they will be offered to set up two-

factor authentication (2FA) via Google Authenticator or SMS. 

 

By default, the crypto-wallet will store private keys on the BitRewards Network servers in an encrypted 

form. The encryption key will be created from the access key of the customer, with which they login to 

the BitRewards app (Facebook Access Token or Password Hash). The key will be deciphered only in 

the presence of the active login session of the key owner. 

 

For advanced customers who are concerned about the security issue of the third-party wallets, there 

will be following options available: 

 

1. Transfer of BIT, ETH and any ERC20 tokens on any external wallet (including hardware wallets). 

2. Downloading a private key from the BitRewards system. In this case, the encrypted private key will 

be deciphered and provided to the customer for storage on their computer or an external carrier, 

and the private key will be removed from the BitRewards Network base. From this time, the 

customer will need to apply the private key for any action in the system connected with movement 

of BTW, ETH or any other tokens. If desired, the private key can be imported to the system again. 

 

As soon as the Lightning Network and Raiden Network technologies become available, the BitRewards 



 27 

Wallet will be integrated with them and become a part of these networks. This will allow BitRewards 

crypto-wallet users to significantly reduce or even cut down to zero the commission for money 

withdrawal, transfers to retailers, or other participants of these networks. 

 

The introduction of Lightning & Raiden will also allow transactions to be carried out instantly (time of 

confirmation of a regular Ethereum-transaction is about 60 seconds, and in the Lightning 

Network/Raiden Network - less than 1 second). 

 

The BitRewards services will not take an additional fee for payments through the Lightning Network 

and the Raiden Network. The cost of these additional services will be offset by the increased rate of 

BIT. 

 

The BitRewards wallet is a single access point and the payment service enabling any non-tech savvy 

user to pay in cryptocurrency on the website of any retailer the BitRewards Network. The customer can 

transfer any cryptocurrency or fiat currency on this wallet and convert it into BitRewards, which retailers 

will accept. We are also talking to payment services providers, who have shown significant interest in 

using the BitRewards infrastructure for the combination of fiat and cryptocurrency payments. 

 

Mobile applications 

The mobile apps on the iOS and Android platforms, which replicate the functionality of the web apps 

will also have the following features: 

 

1. Crypto-wallet 

2. Merchants’ special offers  

3. Scanning and storage of loyalty cards (making plastic cards redundant, the inconvenience of which 

is one of the main reasons customers stop using loyalty systems) 

4. Gift cards 

5. Geofencing

BitRewards Network 

BitRecommendations — AI-driven decentralized recommendations system. 

BitRecommendations is the world’s first decentralized crowdsourced recommendation system, which 

is designed to suit the needs of e-commerce and uses the blockchain for quality control and security of 

the data. 

 

How It Works - for Merchants: 

 Merchants send the encoded data about the activities of their users to the BitRecommendations 

system, and it sends them access to a cutting-edge recommendation system - free of charge. 

 

 BitRecommendations system offers product recommendations (“you may also like”) and 

rewards recommendations - with the possible ways of showing users the appreciation for their 

actions via a thoughtful reward: cryptocurrency, a cup of coffee, or a ticket to an event. 

 

 BitRecommendations learns on the go using data from thousands of merchants and processing 

millions of data points per day, which ensures the top quality of recommendations at all times. 

 

 All the data received from merchants is stored on the decentralized file system IPFS. The 

metadata, including the ratings of data quality, is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This type 

of structure makes the system eternally operable and available to the clients. If 

BitRecommendations somehow ceases to work, with the support of BitRewards DAO, a new 

system can always be created to use that data. 

 

 If a merchant tries to cheat and sends fake data, it will be detected, and this information will go 

to the Ethereum blockchain.  

 

 Merchants can see the previous user activity of every user - that’s why BitRecommendation 

provides the scoring of the user's reputation, which allows the merchants to offer a loan or a 

post-payment for the purchases. 

 

BitRecommendations — the Eyes and Brains of Online Stores 

The recommendation system is a necessary component of the loyalty systems of the merchants - it 

enables them to incentivize higher order value and repeat purchases thus improving the ROI. 

 



 29 

An efficient recommendation system must contain huge amounts of data. This poses a problem for 

small and medium-sized businesses because they can’t acquire the necessary amount of traffic and 

sales to collect that data. 

 

DMP Data Is Not Enough 

Data management platforms, which aggregate data from various sources, are designed to provide 

merchants with the profiles of their users - social graph, interests, disposable income, etc.  

 

This information is useful but insufficient to make high-quality forecasts in e-commerce because user 

habits and consumption patterns are hard to figure out yet they contain data, which is crucial for 

decision-making. 

 

For instance, it’s impossible to predict what color of the device customers will prefer basing their 

assumptions on the data about their age and attraction to a certain car brand. 

 

BitRecommendations is a decentralized DMP designed to collect, store and process the retail data 

using deep learning algorithms. The control of the quality and security of the data is provided for by the 

blockchain. 

 

Every merchant is a source of huge amounts of data about their shoppers. 90% of this data remains 

unused. The best-case scenario is that the data gets sent to Google Analytics where a marketing 

specialist will go through its aggregated copy. 

 

BitRewards will give merchants a solution, which will easily enable them to have all the user data at 

their disposal, including: 

 general data types (viewed items, added to order items, order amount); 

 industry-specific data types about the user interests (colors of garments, gadget screen sizes, 

food calories, etc.). 

 

This data will be collected and stored by the merchant on their servers. Merchants will receive a turnkey 

solution, which can be deployed on any server: 

 every 24 hours the data is encoded and sent into IPFS; 

 the merchant sends the IPFS-address containing the specific data and metadata to the 

BitRecommendations smart-contract (number of the unique per period, merchant ID); 

 the merchant can send this data to the smart-contract of any other organization, to which 

BitRewards DAO has entrusted the private keys — it is necessary to avoid the dependence on 

the centralized BitRecommendations software. 

 



 30 

As soon as the data is received in the smart-contract, BitRecommendations runs several processes: 

 checks the reputation of the merchant. If the reputation is unreliable, the weight of the data is 

set to “low”, or it is simply ignored; 

 downloads the data from IPFS to the BitRecommendations servers; 

 starts the lock-up period (2 weeks at the beginning of the operations) and processes the 

received data via a moderation subsystem. The main purpose of moderation is to determine 

whether or not the data is accurate and came from reliable sources. Another purpose is to attach 

the appropriate weights to the data. To solve this problem, deep learning and AI are applied; 

 after the lock-up period, BitRewards credits the merchant with BitRewards tokens for the 

valuable data and reduces the rating and repayments in case of fake data; 

 the accurate data is used for deep learning algorithms. 

 

 

 

Machine Learning: Product Recommendations 

 

The following dataset sources will be used for the recommendation system learning: 

 third-party DMPs (Oracle Bluekai, Krux, MediaMath, etc.); 

 user activity data shared by the merchants, as described above. 

 

BitRecommendations system is based on the data and machine learning algorithms. It provides API to 

any merchant, developer, or service provider.  

 

The API allows any merchant to receive highly precise product recommendations starting from day one 

of the operations, even with low user traffic, because of the application of algorithms, which make 

decisions after learning on thousands of other merchants and millions of data points. 

 

The payment for the API is accepted in BIT tokens only. 

  

Machine Learning: Rewards Recommendations 

 

BitRecommendations API also empowers every merchant with the knowledge about the reward 

preferences of their users. Based on the assumptions made by the system regarding the preferable 

reward, e.g. a coffee from Starbucks, massage, or a ticket for a favorite band, the system suggests the 

choice which has the potential for the maximum ROI. 

 

BitRecommendations analyses the rewards that were given by the loyalty systems of different 

merchants, aggregates the received data, and makes predictions about the future rewards. 



 31 

 

Machine Learning: Financial Scoring 

 

The purchasing activities and habits of every user become available to all BitRecommendations 

participants (in an encoded, anonymous, and de-personified way). Therefore, the financial scoring 

ultimately becomes available. 

 

It will be used for the following use cases: 

 offering an after-payment of up to 100% or a loan to the users who service their liabilities in a 

reliable way, which can be derived from the historical data and stored in the blockchain; 

 offering user-specific financial and insurance products; 

 offering the incentivizing discounts only to those customers who are motivated by them; 

 avoiding unnecessary discounts for those whose purchasing history suggests that they were 

buying in other stores without the discounts. 

 

Application of the blockchain technology and the crowdsourced nature of the platform will allow the 

merchants to achieve a new level of intelligence and economic efficiency previously unaffordable for 

the small and medium-sized business. 

 

BitRecommendations Business Model 

 

BitRecommendations API will be offered to the majority of the participating merchants free of charge. 

The platform operates on the principle of reciprocity: 

 merchants get BIT tokens for the provided data and pay BIT for using the BitRecommendations 

API. The ratio of the price and reward will be designed so that the store makes equal or larger 

amount of BIT if it shares the data about the activities of all its users with the system; 

 if some merchants prefer not to share data about the activities of their users, they will have to 

pay BIT tokens to use BitRecommendations API. 

 

The hosting and updates of the BitRecommendations system are paid for from the proceeds coming 

from BIT tokens turnover commission, which will be introduced one year after the beginning of the 

operations. 

 

Application of Blockchain and Risk Mitigation 

 

Decentralization of BitRecommendations system makes it invulnerable from the untrustful members of 

the system and ultimately from BitRewards operations.  

 



 32 

However, it will keep its open protocol available for the new members: any e-commerce business will 

be able to connect to it and benefit from the data collected from the thousands of other stores. 

 

 all the data received from the merchants is stored on the decentralized file system IPFS. The 

metadata, including the data quality scoring, is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This 

makes the system genuinely trustless. Should the BitRecommendations system fail to work, 

under the procedures of DAO BitRewards, a new team will be hired, and a new system using 

the aggregated data will be implemented; 

 if a merchant tries to cheat and provides fake data, this will be detected, and the score of that 

merchant will be downgraded leading to the payment of less amount of BIT for their data. 

Potentially, the scoring can go down to zero when the data that is received from this merchant 

is not used by the system, and the merchant does not receive remuneration for the provided 

data. In this case, the merchant will have to pay in order to use the BitRecommendations 

system. Merchant score is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. 

 

By virtue of using BIT tokens, BitRecommendations can offer this cutting-edge data-driven 

recommendation service for valuable members of the system, completely free of charge. 

 

 

BitRewards DAO 

After the token launch, we will create the decentralized autonomous organization, BitRewards (DAO). 

The objectives of DAO: 

1. Run BitRewards business in the most efficient way 

2. Create favorable conditions for the adoption of BitRewards platform by the large numbers of 

merchants 

3. Create favorable conditions for the BIT token price appreciation 

 

The mandate of DAO: 

1. Management of the BitRewards Foundation. 

a. Remuneration to persons and organizations developing new integration for the 

BitRewards system and increasing the demand for BIT. 

b. Remuneration to persons and organizations that connect new stores to the BitRewards 

system and thereby increase the demand for BIT. 

c. Remuneration to any persons and organizations that in one way or another increase 

the demand for BIT and thereby increase the price of BIT. 

Management of a smart liquidity contract (Bancor Exchanger)  



 33 

a. Including, maintenance of necessary reserves on a smart liquidity contract in BIT and 

Ether. 

Management of BitRewards Intellectual Property 

a. Including, control over the source code of BitRewards 

Monitoring the entire BitRewards ecosystem and strategic decision making 

 

Sources of funds in the BitRewards Foundation: 

1. 12% of the total number of issued tokens; 

2. From 10% to 20% of the funds raised during the token launch (depending on the collected 

amount) 

The sources of funds for BitRewards Foundation may change in the future. 

Technically, DAO will be implemented on the Wings platform. 

 

DAO Management Scheme: 

A member of DAO is an individual or a legal entity that has made transactions with BIT. The different 

types of membership (weights) are defined by the amount and features of operations with BIT during 

a certain period of time, preceding the estimation of the type of the membership. 

The majority of the decisions of the DAO are made by voting (simple majority). 

Any member of the DAO can put forward proposals. 

The proposals include a description of the action, amount, purpose and conditions for transferring 

funds from the DAO accounts (if applicable). 

In addition to the usual members of DAO, it can have Super Users. 

Super User Rights: 

1. Conduct everyday operations and management of DAO within the standard nature of its 

business; 

2. Instantly transfer any amounts between DAO accounts by a smart liquidity contract on Bancor 

technology or change the composition of the basket of currencies in DAO accounts; 

3. Put forward high priority proposals (including withdrawal of funds from DAO accounts), which 

are automatically executed 1 week after the date of the proposal, except for cases when at 

least 20% of participants are vetoing the execution of the proposal (veto power of DAO 

participants). 

4. Change the operational and other rules of the DAO according to the procedure of paragraph. 

 

Super Users are appointed or removed by voting (with a 67% majority). 

 

At the beginning of DAO operations, the BitRewards team will act as the Super User. In the event that 

the BitRewards team runs the business unsatisfactorily or loses the trust of the DAO members for 

other reasons, this may change, and DAO can elect other Super Users. 



 34 

 

About the open source of BitRewards software: 

The entire source code of all BitRewards products will be publicly available under a special license. 

The license will allow the usage and modification of the source code only for personal non-

commercial purposes (experiments, etc.). Usage or modification for commercial purposes will be 

prohibited. 

The license can be changed by the decision of DAO. Also, DAO may grant special rights to use and 

modify the source code to any individuals and organizations at its own discretion. 

The objectives of this type of license are: 

1. To enable the members of DAO to resume the BitRewards platform operations at any time, 

and also to continue its development if the BitRewards team fails to fulfill its obligations. 

2. Exclude the creation of BitRewards system’s clones, competing with BitRewards and working 

with other cryptocurrencies, which may potentially reduce the demand on BIT. 

BitRewards Operator 

 

The BitRewards Operator’s goal will be to service merchants and provide a better level of service to 

their users with the help of BitRewards apps. It will promote the platform among other solutions 

providers with the view to enable them to use distributed ledger technologies to improve their products 

and to help spread the BitRewards tokens global adoption. The Operator will offer extended support, 

design new solutions for the retail industry, and provide legal, tax and accounting counseling to the 

merchants. 

Bancor Liquidity smart contract 

Provides for BIT’s seamless convert into crypto- and fiat. (Please go to “Liquidity smart contract” section 

for more details.)  

 

Business model 

BitRewards Network profits from the growth in value of the BIT token, therefore it provides basic 

customer software and apps for the retailers free of charge. Although it will be possible for the 

developers of the Smart Rewards apps within the BitRewards ecosystem to charge the merchants for 

the customary tools, the BitRewards in its first year of operations will not take commission from 

transactions, aiming to provide maximum efficiency to the merchants.  

 

This demonstrates that BitRewards is committed to the growth in value of BIT, which strategically 

corresponds to the interests of token holders. Our strategy is the maximum adoption and utility of the 



 35 

apps that are built on BitRewards platform among retailers, which will increase the demand for tokens, 

their adoption and price. 

 

After 12 months of operations, we will introduce 0.5% commission on the sales transactions with 

BitRewards tokens.  

 

Also, the special administration entity BitRewards Operator can offer paid services as a result of 

retailers’ inquiries, as they will be interested in our expertise. Such services may include: 

 

 Customary apps for specific business goals (e.g. a sophisticated bounty campaign); 

 Adjustments of settings and the testing of hypothesis of the rewards and other parameters of the 

loyalty system; 

 The integration of customary blockchain solutions in the existing corporate loyalty program; 

 

The BitRewards Network does not see such development as a priority and considers it the most efficient 

to transfer such types of important services to independent contractors, BitRewards enthusiasts, and 

community members with which we plan to work. This will help the adoption of the BitRewards platform 

and broader acceptance of BIT.

This calculation is based on the historical data of GIFTD rewards and loyalty solutions provider. 

 

The value of the network grows in the process of adoption by a large number of participants, who start 

using BitRewards.  

 

 

 
 



 38 

According to the estimates, in the case of a conservative forecast (reaching a softcap of $3,000,000), 

the targeted funds will be sufficient to sign up 5,000 retailers in 3 years, which will generate a monthly 

demand for BIT worth $4.9 million. 

 

Go to market strategy 

BitRewards promotion among retailers, content management systems, website builders, and e-

commerce service providers is one of the key tasks, as the BIT token value directly depends on the 

number of merchants in the network and the intensity of the adoption of the BitRewards rewards and 

loyalty apps.  

 

We have signed a letter of intent with Ecwid, one of the top e-commerce website builders with over 1 

million merchants in 175 countries, headquartered in San Diego, CA, USA. We plan to conclude 

agreements with all major content management platforms for online commerce. They are keen to use 

our product. 

 

Since we aim to develop a large community of BitRewards adopters, we plan to offer the comprehensive 

loyalty solutions and applications of BitRewards loyalty system free of charge.  

The value of such service is at least $200/month, for a small online store, and up to several thousand 

dollars for a large store. Such an offer is unprecedented and comprises a key component to our go-to-

market strategy.  

 

We will also open the platform’s code for the community and allow the development of the apps for any 

interested party. The developers will be able to offer their apps on their terms to retailers and make a 

commission income. 

 

The broad adoption by the retailers and their customers will ignite a network effect that provides for 

explosive growth and wards off competition. Given that the retailers’ rewards and loyalty systems 

market does not have an exclusive leader, a decentralized free system like BitRewards, will take a 

significant share and can become a market standard, which we aim to achieve.  

 

To attract the highest number of merchants using the BitRewards system, it is planned to apply three 

core strategies: 

 

 Active interaction with the community of entrepreneurs and online stores’ owners and managers 

 Partnerships with e-commerce platforms and website builders 

 Relationships with developers and service providers 



 39 

Active interaction with a community of entrepreneurs and 
online store owners 

Our target audience is small and medium online retailers. Although we see value from BitRewards in 

many different verticals, from brick-and-mortar stores, to employee loyalty solutions, the sweet spot for 

us is online stores selling consumer goods or services with traffic between 10 to 500 thousand monthly 

unique users, which we presently assess at 100-200 thousand clients. 

BitRewards has strong competitive advantages in comparison with other loyalty systems: 

Free of charge 

 Simple installation which doesn't require technical expertise 

 Access to a large number of loyal customers of partner retailers in the BitRewards  

Following the current trend, the focus in promotion of BitRewards Network will be made on content 

marketing, which will push the message to merchants that the BitRewards Network offers much more 

than any competitor can offer, and moreover it’s for free. 

To sign up the vast number of merchants, it is planned to use the following marketing channels: 

 Social networks  

Content production for our blog, email, social media and other outbound activities. We have high 

conversion rate after the live demo presentation of our solutions: after the initial presentation, 30-

50% of the clients covert within 1-2 months. 

 

In the USA we’ve found out that there’s a great demand from 2 interesting verticals inside the 

ecommerce space, which we’ve never explored before: 

1. Event organizers who sell tickets for events through Eventbrite, for which the organizers want 

to reward points to their clients, who can later redeem these points for new ticket purchases. 

2. Start-ups, who need a referral system and are ready to pay cash for new clients. 

We are excited about these developments and plan to sign up several hundreds of active 

merchants in the first year. 

 Workshops, webinars and events 

Hosting seminars, webinars and participating in conferences, as well as partnering with digital 

agencies who service online stores, and for whom we have already launched a partner affiliate 

program.

Partnerships  

Co-operation with website builders and CMSs for online stores (platforms like Shopify, Magento, 

WordPress, Ecwid, etc.), as a lot of our clients are coming from these sources and they are the easiest 

to convert. They are interested in the development of the e-commerce ecosystem, and are very keen 

adopters of the services that help online stores’ efficiency.  

 

Relationships with developers and services providers 

BitRewards Network will provide an open source ecosystem for retailers’ solutions providers, so that 

they can profit from the creation of the apps that they provide within the network. The developers will 

be able to use the software and template apps of BitRewards Network and develop custom apps for 

any e-commerce business and every other case where smart rewards are applicable. The BitRewards 

Network ensures that developers benefit from both the creation and adoption of software, arranging 

prizes and hackathons, and providing the remuneration from the retailers directly. The solutions that 

attract the highest demand from retailers will earn monetary rewards for the developers. Developers 

and retailers will also be able to vote for the most necessary features and initiate the creation of new 

functionality of the platform.

Anton Soloviev 
Head of partners,  

InSales (A leading online stores’ builder) 
 

Wow to BitRewards, chaps! We’ve recommended GIFTD tools to 

the retailers that open their online stores with our platform for a 

couple of years now. We are one of the largest e-commerce 

platforms in Europe, with thousands of clients, and I’m on a 

constant lookout for new cool tech that we or our clients can work 

with. BitRewards currency concept is pretty amazing, and I’ve told 

the guys for a long time that online stores want to be given the real 

McCoy cash for their friends’ purchases. We’ve got hundreds of clients who asked about the feature, 

and BitRewards currency solves this beautifully, while giving tons of extra features, with no pain in the 

neck about taxes and legal stuff. Well done! Looking forward to the future! 

 
 

Roman Gryanko,  

Chairman,  

Assist (One of the largest Ecommerce payment systems in the Eastern

The BitRewards team has already delivered the amazing 

technology behind their rewards and digital gift cards for 

ecommerce businesses. We have been following the team for 

several years now and a lot of times recommend their solutions to 

our clients. We talked a lot with Alex  (Egorov, CEO) about how 

the payments technologies in online stores can be improved with 

the application of blockchain, and plan to use the BitRewards platform when it goes live. The solution 

is amazingly simple and efficient, and we are looking forward to implementing it into our payment 

system. BitRewards will allow us to expand our user base, and add methods of payment with 

cryptocurrencies, which is a must in the current environment and increases ever more interest among 

our clients.

History and current progress of the 
company 

 

In 2013, Alexander Nevidimov joined Alex as the CTO to work on the GIFTD project in the sphere of 

gift cards, bonuses and rewards in e-commerce. Mr. Nevidimov had vast experience in the 

cryptocurrencies field, having worked before as one of the main developers for one of the top Bitcoin 

mining pools. 

This experience made the team experiment with digital currencies, which merchants or brands can 

issue and use on their own, and GIFTD was constantly looking for chances to apply blockchain to the 

product, which, however, was a little too exotic for the corporate world in 2012. 

The team started building a centralized digital gift cards and promo codes processing platform, 

approaching it as a financial product with a view towards allowing the issuance of the brand’s own 

currency, which can be converted into commonly accepted cash (regular prepaid gift cards), or paid for 

different client’s actions (free gift cards and promo codes) and started offering it in the market in 2015. 

GIFTD has developed several standard e-commerce solutions that are installed by more than 500 

online merchants and this figure will go to more than 1000 in 2018. 

In 2016, it became clear to the GIFTD team that the blockchain will inevitably be adopted among its 

corporate clients and their customers. With this in mind CTO Alexander Nevidimov started to put 

together the Blockchain R&D department. In 2017, the department started to have regular meeting and 

is now 10 tech people strong. 

Product roadmap 

The BitRewards Network is being developed as the next essential component of the GIFTD rewards 

and loyalty system. 

We currently have the tested solutions - widgets that merchants can install on the top of their websites 

and social networks, which give rewards in the form of points or discounts to the users. A part of the 

solution is the customer’s dashboard or wallet with points, where they see the points they have earned 

or redeemed and other features. 

Product development consists of 10 stages. The total costs of stages 1-8 will come to US$2 million. 

Depending on the amount that will be raised during the ICO, these stages’ timeline can be accelerated. 

The execution of stages 9-10 will cost US$1 million.  

All the costs include operations and sales and marketing activities. Unlike many other blockchain 

startups, we anticpate that only 27% of the total costs will be spent on product development, because 

a lot of essential components of the system have already been developed and tested.  

Depending on the ICO results and adoption of the product of the previous stages, we can embark on 

stages 9-10 earlier than planned. 



 59 

 

The funds that we raise beyond the soft cap will be invested in sales marketing activities, which will 

help us sign up more merchants more quickly, creating a stronger network effect and delivering the 

product features faster. Additional funds will also be used for opening of new geographical markets 

faster and delivering new features of the product, which were not mentioned in the pipeline below. 

 

This product roadmap may not be final and is subject to adjustments depending on the feedback 

we receive from early BitRewards adopters.   

 

 
 

Stage 1: Development of a points based loyalty system, GIFTD designed to 

reward shoppers. (Сompleted) 

Time: November, 2016 - February, 2017  

 

Purpose: 

To create a fully functional rewards system with automated rebate and referral mechanics. It will be 

installed by default on top of the merchants’ websites and initially tested with the selected merchants 

issuing BIT instead of merchants’ points to their customers. Contains a dashboard and “points” wallet, 

a prototype for the BitRewards wallet.  

 



 60 

Results: The solution was developed and tested with several merchants and service providers. It 

allowed the team to conduct the necessary customer development activities and fully understand 

merchants’ and customers’ needs. 

 

Stage 2: Structuring the concept of using the Ethereum blockchain with 

loyalty and rewards tools, and customer development of the crypto-

rewards for e-commerce industry, team hiring. (Сompleted) 

Time: February – October, 2017  

 

Purpose: 

To invent a simple and frictionless, yet secure, structure that enables non-tech-savvy merchants to 

easily reward and redeem cryptocurrency from non-tech-savvy users. Should the security have any 

chance of being compromised, it will outweigh any benefits the platform may bring. 

 

Results: 

A clear and compelling structure has been drafted and accepted by the team members and advisors. 

Security elements were contemplated and shaped so that hypothetically, no gross threat to the 

BitRewards Network system will exist at any point in time. It was decided that Lightning Network and 

Raiden Network technologies should be applied to provide for the speed, better user experience, and 

cost efficiency (implementation upon their tested versions of said technologies are production mode 

ready).  

 

Stage 3: The full-functioning loyalty system BitRewards for the retailer and 

the user's crypto-wallet connected to the loyalty program, with access on 

the website of retailer and BitRewards website.  

Time: October 2017 - May 2018 

 

Purpose: Development of a fully functioning core BitRewards product. The system is based on GIFTD 

Loyalty program and includes a crypto-rebate system, rewarding users’ and referrals’ purchases. It 

comprises the retailer’s dashboard with the possibility of setting a percentage from the purchase 

amount, which the smart contract transfers in BIT Token and sends to the customer. At this stage it is 

also planned to implement the BitRewards customer’s wallet (Customer’s Wallet). Payment with BIT at 

the retailers’ online stores, transfers of the BIT to external Ethereum wallets from the Customer’s Wallet, 

and transfers of the Ethereum based currencies to Customer’s Wallet will also become possible at this 

stage. 

 



 61 

At Stage 3, it is also planned to launch a sales and marketing subsidiary in the USA, which will carry 

out global operations for English speaking countries.  

Costs: $1.01 million 

 

 

Stage 4: Retailer Crypto-wallet and liquidity management smart contract  

Time: March - June, 2018  

Purpose: Release of a uniform solution for retailers, with which they can make operations with their 

customers and between each other. The crypto-wallet of the retailer represents the Smart contract tied 

to the BitRewards Network. Settings allow for the ability to check automatically the balance of BIT and 

to recharge it if necessary. This wallet can be used by default for the transfer of rewards to customers 

and for the reception of BIT as a means of payment for goods or services. The fiat currencies or the 

BIT of the retailer are kept in this wallet. The retailer can pay for BIT from this wallet if he has to acquire 

them from BitRewards.  

 

During this stage, the DAO and the service company BitRewards Operator, which will support the 

transactions in BIT will also be fully deployed and the Bancor smart contract will be launched. 

Costs: 130k 

 

 

Stage 5: Integration of loyalty system with Lightning Network and Raiden 

Network (after the launch of these technologies). 

Time: June - July, 2018 

Purpose: To enable fast, free and secure BitRewards tokens transactions for merchants and 

customers. Lightning and Raiden technologies allow almost immediate remittance and confirmation of 

Ethereum based tokens. These technologies will be integrated as soon as they are tested and become 

available in the full production mode. 

Costs: 170k 

 

 

Stage 6: Customer’s Mobile app with crypto-wallet. 

Time: June - August, 2018 

Purpose: To provide customers with a single point of access to their wallet via BitRewards Mobile app 

for iOS and Android and use it online and offline. At this stage the special offers of the BitRewards 

Network merchants and partners will become available within the app, and users will be able to 

purchase them with BIT and other currencies.  



 62 

At this stage, the best offers from global CPA affiliate networks will be added to the customer’s wallet, 

which will allow customers earning tokens for purchases with thousands online stores globally. 

Costs: 160k 

 

 

Stage 7: The Alfa-version of the AI-based rewards recommendation and 

items recommendation. 

Time: July - November, 2018 

 

Purpose: To provide early adopters with efficient recommendation tools that improve the loyalty of the 

customers and increases sales and achieve efficient results from the split-testing for the key target 

audiences of merchants. 

To further provide an omni-channel shopping experience to the customers. Digital gift cards, scanning 

of loyalty cards into the mobile wallet and the geofencing and merchant search engine will be 

developed. 

At this stage, we will open a subsidiary and focus on the promotion of our products in the Asian market.  

Costs: 490k 

 

 

Stage 8: Mobile SDK for merchants’ apps. 

Time: September - December, 2018 

 

Purpose: To provide merchants’ proprietary mobile apps with BitRewards loyalty and cryptocurrency 

wallets. 

Costs: 170k 

 

 

Stage 9: Integration of AI and machine learning into the BitRewards 

platform. 

Time: January - April, 2019 

 

Purpose: Predictive analysis platform with AI recommendations’ mechanism. After this stage, the data 

collected by the platform will be used to predict customers’ behavior and automatically select the best 

incentivization tool and make the best offer, along with the improvement of the merchants’ efficiency. 

Costs: 680k 

 



 63 

Stage 10: Blockchain based traffic exchange between online and offline 

merchants. 

Time: April - May, 2019  

 

Purpose: To drive new traffic to the BitRewards Network member merchants via omni-channel real-

time customer behavior analysis and recommendations. 

 

We consider BitRewards as a decentralized system, since the launch, decisions on necessary 

completions will be made by the forces of community which will influence the goal-setting process and 

interact actively with the team. The most part of the system components will be developed on an open-

source basis, and we encourage all developers to take part in the completion of the system. 

Costs: 180k

Accredited U.S. Investor Verification 

An accredited investor, in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who: 

 earned income that exceeded USD 200,000 (or USD 300,000 together with a spouse) in each 

of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR 

 has a net worth over USD one million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the 

value of the person’s primary residence). 

On the income test, the person must satisfy the thresholds for the three years consistently either alone 

or with a spouse, and cannot, for example, satisfy one year based on individual income and the next 

two years based on joint income with a spouse. The only exception is if a person is married within this 

period, in which case the person may satisfy the threshold on the basis of joint income for the years 

during which the person was married and on the basis of individual income for the other years.If 

calculating joint net worth with a spouse, it is not necessary that property be held jointly. Calculating net 

mailto:support@bitrewards.network


 71 

worth involves adding up all your assets and subtracting all your liabilities. The resulting sum is your 

net worth. 

The value of your primary residence is not included in your net worth calculation. In addition, any 

mortgage or other loan on the residence does not count as a liability up to the fair market value of the 

residence. If the loan is for more than the fair market value of the residence (i.e., if your mortgage is 

underwater), then the loan amount that is over the fair market value counts as a liability under the net 

worth test. Further, any increase in the loan amount in the 60 days prior to your purchase of the 

securities (even if the loan amount does not exceed the value of the residence) will count as a liability 

as well. The reason for this is to prevent net worth from being artificially inflated through converting 

home equity into cash or other assets. 

In addition, entities such as banks, partnerships, corporations, nonprofits and trusts may be accredited 

investors. Of the entities that would be considered accredited investors and depending on your 

circumstances, the following may be relevant to you: 

 any trust, with total assets in excess of USD five million, not formed to specifically purchase the 

subject securities, whose purchase is directed by a sophisticated person,  or 

 any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors. 

The SEC does not require any specific verification method or process for accredited investor 

verification. Depending on the circumstances, the company may rely on a written confirmation from a 

third party to verify your accredited investor status. 

In order to verify your accredited investor status please provide to support@bitrewards.network a 

written confirmation of your accredited investor status obtained from any of the following third parties:  

 a registered brokerdealer: or 

 SEC-registered investment adviser; or 

 licensed attorney; or  

 certified public accountant.  

Such third party could be engaged directly by you (e.g., your personal broker-dealer, investment 

adviser, attorney or certified public accountant).  

You can obtain information about a registered broker by visiting FINRA’s BrokerCheck website: 

https://brokercheck.finra.org/ 

You can obtain information about an investment adviser by visiting the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public 

Disclosure website: https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ 

You can obtain information about a licensed attorney or certified public accountant by contacting the 

appropriate state bar or board of accountancy.
