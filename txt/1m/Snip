The​ ​decentralized,​ ​user-generated​ ​news​ ​platform

Abstract​ ​(Vision) 

News is broken. A small group of corporations decide which information is worthy of              
print, promoting clickbait and biased articles, and people who create great content are             
rarely rewarded for their hard efforts. No wonder that trust in the media is at an                
all-time​ ​low. 

Snip is a new type of news platform, decentralized and powered by the community. On               
Snip, anyone can write a news story about any topic, and readers can find news that                
matters to them. Contributors are rewarded with tokens according to the popularity of             
their posts and comments. A community-based news site, owned by the community,            
can become the top news site in the world and cover any subject, from breaking news                
to​ ​entertainment​ ​and​ ​everything​ ​in​ ​between. 

The content on the platform is personalized for each user using an open-source             
newsfeed algorithm, and users can choose their own algorithm. Since people prefer            
reading short and concise stories, the default algorithm assigns higher value to short             
content. 

At Snip we strongly believe that there shouldn’t be a single arbiter of the truth and that                 
relying on content selected by the mainstream media is a form of censorship. Snip              
content is not censored and is stored in a decentralized manner. Users will choose their               
own trusted content filters, allowing them to ignore specific words or sources of             
content, but any legal content meeting basic community standards (e.g. not spam) will             
be​ ​allowed​ ​to​ ​stay​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform.

but​ ​a​ ​great​ ​writer​ ​can​ ​come​ ​from​ ​anywhere.”

1.​ ​Introduction 
The Internet has profoundly changed the news industry. In the past, local and             

national publishers enjoyed a monopoly on the distribution of information, providing           
them with a strong hold on reader’s attention, which in turn provided them with a               
constant stream of revenue from advertisers. The barriers to entry for new publishers             
were​ ​high,​ ​requiring​ ​them​ ​to​ ​have​ ​enough​ ​capital​ ​to​ ​buy​ ​or​ ​rent​ ​printing​ ​presses. 

The first sign of change appeared in 1996, when an e-mail list named Craigslist              
turned into a website for classified advertisements. Classified ads were a strong source             
of revenue for newspapers worldwide, and in a few years Craigslist and similar             
websites practically destroyed this source of revenue. A study shows ​[1] that from             
2000 to 2007 the news industry lost approximately $5 Billion in classified ad revenues              
to Craigslist. From the launch of Craigslist in 1996 to today, it’s safe to assume that the                 
industry​ ​has​ ​lost​ ​more​ ​than​ ​$10​ ​Billion​ ​in​ ​revenue​ ​due​ ​to​ ​Craigslist​ ​alone. 

Classified ads aren’t the only reason news outlets became less profitable. When            
news outlets moved from printed papers to the Internet and started offering advertising             
space, they no longer held a monopoly. The same ads that appeared on their websites               
appeared in blogs and in non-news platforms, and eventually superior ads appeared on             
Google and later Facebook. With more advertising options, brands paid less for ad real              
estate,​ ​leaving​ ​publishers​ ​with​ ​less​ ​income. 

At the same time, the Internet created a major new problem for publishers - the               
need to create unique content. When distribution was owned by publishers they could             
afford to create poor content which was substantially similar to content from other             
news providers, and readers couldn’t easily switch to a different news outlet. On the              
Internet, users are always a click away from a competitor’s website, and if a              
publisher’s content isn’t engaging enough, it is quickly ignored in favor of another             
news​ ​outlet. 

The Internet brought another important revolution - the rise of user-generated           
content. Instead of readers hoping to get a column published in a known newspaper,              
now anyone can create a website and broadcast their thoughts to the world. This              
change has been facilitated by early platforms like Geocities and Blogger.com and            
later WordPress, Tumblr, Medium, Facebook, and others. User-generated content has          
gradually gained more and more of reader’s attentions, leaving classic publishers with            
a smaller share of attention and a smaller share of ad revenue. The competition with               
user-generated content is especially tough for news outlets, since many users create            
basic news content for free, hoping to propagate their ideas and not necessarily             
expecting​ ​profit. 

Most news outlets were unable to create high-quality content good enough to            
compete in the Internet age, and in order to stay in business they pivoted to three main                 
types​ ​of​ ​content: 

3 

https://paperpile.com/c/r3AxY0/8EYB


 

1. Entertainment - For example. quizzes like “Which Harry Potter character are           
you?”​ ​or​ ​​ ​amusing​ ​photos​ ​like​ ​“5​ ​of​ ​the​ ​best-looking​ ​politicians​ ​in​ ​the​ ​world.” 

2. Clickbait​ ​Articles​ ​-​ ​For​ ​example​ ​“You’ll​ ​never​ ​believe​ ​how​ ​this​ ​girl​ ​...”  

3. Provocative Op-eds - For example, “This scandal shows everything that’s          
wrong​ ​with...” 

In some cases, several types of content are combined together, such as “Three             
reasons why the Democratic/Republican party is ruining America”. Users don’t value           
this kind of content and most of them don’t develop loyalty to news brands who               
publish it, but the entertainment and outrage drive user traffic, which provides enough             
ad​ ​revenue​ ​to​ ​keep​ ​the​ ​publisher​ ​in​ ​business. 

1.1.​ ​Monetization​ ​of​ ​Internet​ ​Content 

At the beginning of the Internet age, text and image ads had a relatively high               
conversion rate ​[2]​, allowing corporate and independent websites to monetize their           
content directly. Over time, users got used to the ads and started ignoring them,              
causing click rates to go down and revenues to decline. Many websites responded with              
more disruptive ads (pop-ups, autoplay videos, etc.), which in turn alienated users and             
encouraged the adoption of ad-blockers. Today, publishers of internet content have to            
use​ ​one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following​ ​methods​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​generate​ ​revenues. 

1.1.1.​ ​Subscriptions 

The most direct method to monetize content online is to charge for access to              
the content. Subscriptions are growing as a source of revenue, partly thanks to the              
2016 elections ​[3,4]​, but are mostly limited to high-end brands like The New York              
Times, The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal. Most news outlets don’t have an              
enthusiastic, affluent following which is willing to pay, and must provide their content             
for free to survive. A large majority of people view news content as a product which                
should​ ​be​ ​provided​ ​to​ ​users​ ​for​ ​free​ ​and​ ​subsidized​ ​by​ ​ads. 

1.1.2.​ ​Ad​ ​Networks​ ​&​ ​Tracking 

Traditional ads are still an important part of the news ecosystem and the main              
source of revenue for most news outlets. Instead of serving their own ads, most              
websites present ads through ad networks, companies which track users across the            
Internet, gather various types of information about their habits, and attempt to present             
the most relevant ads. This is achieved by planting “cookies” (a kind of digital tracker)               
on Internet browsers, allowing the ad networks to follow a single user as they browse               
various websites. In an attempt to create more engaging ads, sometimes ad networks             
will also purchase data on users from online data brokers, who collect data on users in                
various methods ​[5,6]​. The tracking methods applied by ad networks are generally            
hidden, and users are kept ignorant of the data collected on them. The most famous ad

network is Google’s AdSense, but there are many lesser-known ad networks that are             
quite​ ​widespread.  

For a growing number of users, the price of ad networks is not only less               
privacy but also a higher data bill. On many websites the browser loads more ad               
tracker data than actual content, and most of the loading time on the website is various                
ads and ad trackers ​[7]​. For users who are browsing the Internet on a mobile device,                
this means higher data costs and an inferior user experience. The data costs have been               
another contributing factor to the prevalence of ad-blockers, especially in developing           
markets,​ ​as​ ​seen​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​chart​ ​​[8]​: 

 

Despite the massive use of trackers on Internet websites, ad-blockers and low click             
rates have reduced the efficiency of standard advertising, encouraging the rise of native             
advertising. 

1.1.3.​ ​Native​ ​Advertising 

Definition​ ​from​ ​Wikipedia​ ​​[9]​: 

Native advertising is a type of advertising, mostly online, that matches the form and function of the                 
platform upon which it appears. In many cases, it manifests as either an article or video, produced                 
by an advertiser with the specific intent to promote a product, while matching the form and style                 
which would otherwise be seen in the work of the platform's editorial staff. The word "native"                
refers​ ​to​ ​this​ ​coherence​ ​of​ ​the​ ​content​ ​with​ ​the​ ​other​ ​media​ ​that​ ​appears​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform. 

The most noticeable examples of native advertising are the promoted search           
results on Google and the sponsored posts on Facebook. These ads are very effective              
and account for more than 80% of the revenue of the two companies ​[10]​, or $107                
Billion in 2016. The main reason that native advertising is so effective is that most

users fail to notice that a specific piece of content is sponsored, and click on it                
assuming​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​is​ ​actually​ ​providing​ ​them​ ​with​ ​the​ ​most​ ​relevant​ ​content. 

In the past years, news websites have gradually embraced the trend of native             
advertising. Since the native format of these websites is news articles, their ads consist              
of commercial content disguised as a regular news article. Some news outlets mark the              
content as sponsored but many do not ​[11]​, and many times users reach these articles               
via​ ​social​ ​media​ ​and​ ​don’t​ ​ever​ ​see​ ​an​ ​indication​ ​that​ ​the​ ​content​ ​is​ ​sponsored. 

As opposed to commercials on ad networks, native advertising requires the           
advertiser to create content specifically for a single platform. This provides a            
significant advantage to large platforms, which have the scale needed to make native             
content creation worthwhile, and also have the sale force necessary to engage the             
advertisers. Effectively, small news websites and bloggers can’t utilize native          
advertising. 

1.1.4.​ ​Affiliates​ ​&​ ​Donations 

Small news outlets and bloggers use ad networks but usually can’t generate            
significant income from them. Instead, they depend upon affiliate ads and reader            
donations.​ ​The​ ​profits​ ​are​ ​meager,​ ​but​ ​enough​ ​to​ ​maintain​ ​​ ​many​ ​sites.  
 
1.2.​ ​The​ ​Consolidation​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Internet 

The trends described previously have created a winner-takes-all environment,         
in​ ​which​ ​Facebook​ ​and​ ​Google​ ​reap​ ​a​ ​large​ ​majority​ ​of​ ​the​ ​revenue​ ​​[12,13]​: 

 

Facebook, specifically, holds a great deal of user’s attention, allowing the company to             
influence the type of content made by news publishers. For instance, to satisfy the              
preferences of the Facebook newsfeed algorithm, news outlets are creating original           
video​ ​content​ ​which​ ​is​ ​intended​ ​solely​ ​for​ ​their​ ​Facebook​ ​audience​ ​​[14]​.

https://paperpile.com/c/r3AxY0/pEOb
https://paperpile.com/c/r3AxY0/AZec+mlwt
https://paperpile.com/c/r3AxY0/z73e


 

In the past few years, news outlets have created a significant amount of native              
content on Facebook to encourage users to engage with their website, with Facebook             
enjoying the ad revenue associated with the content and refusing to share it with              
publishers. Independent bloggers who want to reach a large audience also post on             
Facebook, with no hope of receiving a portion of the income that Facebook reaps from               
user’s engagement with the posts. Alternatively, they can post on a blogging website             
like Medium or Tumblr, or even on Twitter, but there still have no hope of receiving a                 
cash​ ​reward​ ​for​ ​their​ ​great​ ​content.  

Facebook’s control over the Internet is especially worrisome because of its           
walled garden. The content on Facebook isn’t on the open web and is blocked to               
search engines. Users who try to access it without a Facebook account encounter             
annoying pop-ups encouraging them to sign in, and often cannot access the content at              
all.​ ​The​ ​same​ ​is​ ​true​ ​for​ ​Twitter​ ​posts,​ ​though​ ​to​ ​a​ ​lesser​ ​extent. 

The people who suffer the most from the current system are independent            
bloggers and small news outlets. Unless they succeed in creating extremely viral            
content, these content creators have basically no way to create content profitably.            
Unfortunately, even high-quality viral content may not be profitable enough to pay the             
bills. In 2016, a Mother Jones story on private prisons in the US reached a massive                
audience and was discussed nationally, but only racked $5,000 in ad revenue, while             
costing the magazine $350,000 ​[15]​. This example demonstrates that the current           
system is not sustainable for great investigative journalism outside of the main news             
outlets.

2.​ ​Solution​ ​-​ ​Snip 
Solving the problems of the news industry requires a product which isn’t an             

incremental improvement but a revolutionary advancement. Such a solution would          
have to create significant value for news consumers, be transparent and fair in the              
distribution​ ​of​ ​news,​ ​and​ ​award​ ​great​ ​content​ ​creators. 

2.1.​ ​Overview 

Snip is a decentralized, user-generated news platform where anyone can write a            
news story (“snip”) about a topic of their choice, and read news on the issues they care                 
about. The platform has no editor deciding what’s fit to print and the decision which               
content​ ​to​ ​view​ ​is​ ​made​ ​personally,​ ​by​ ​community​ ​users. 

Snip’s goal is to become the place where people go to learn and stay updated               
on any subject - politics, tech, sports, art, philosophy, etc. The stories are presented to               
readers in an algorithmic feed, tailored to each user’s interests using open-source            
algorithms (detailed in section 2.4). People are busy and prefer to read concise content,              
so the platform will be oriented towards short content. Writers will be able to post               
content​ ​of​ ​any​ ​length.. 

The platform is powered by the community, with members writing stories,           
voting on the best stories, engaging in discussions, and rewarding contributors with            
tokens. The important role of community feedback gives writers an incentive to create             
high-quality content. The voting mechanism also assists in personalizing content for           
users,​ ​creating​ ​a​ ​feed​ ​which​ ​is​ ​truly​ ​valuable​ ​and​ ​interesting.  

By harnessing the power of the community, Snip aims to become the top news              
destination on every subject. Importantly, the product will be accessible to anyone, and             
will​ ​not​ ​require​ ​an​ ​understanding​ ​of​ ​cryptocurrencies​ ​and​ ​tokens.  

The Snip platform will feature a new Ethereum-based (ERC20) token named           
SnipCoin, which is used to buy products on the Snip network and to reward content               
contributors.​ ​The​ ​role​ ​of​ ​the​ ​token​ ​is​ ​detailed​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​pages. 

2.2.​ ​Freedom​ ​of​ ​Speech 

As opposed to other platforms, users in the Snip community will enjoy freedom             
of​ ​speech,​ ​without​ ​a​ ​centralized​ ​authority​ ​dictating​ ​right​ ​from​ ​wrong.​ ​Therefore: 

1. Snip​ ​does​ ​not​ ​censor​ ​content​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform. 
2. Users​ ​will​ ​never​ ​be​ ​banned​ ​or​ ​shadow​ ​banned. 
3. To ensure the integrity of the content, all posts and comments will be stored in               

the​ ​decentralized​ ​service​ ​IPFS. 
4. On the Snip website, content may be redacted according to local law, for             

instance​ ​in​ ​cases​ ​of​ ​copyright​ ​violations​ ​or​ ​violent​ ​threats. 

8 



 

2.3.​ ​Content​ ​Creation 

News stories need to be original and provide insight. Stories that copy content             
from an existing news story (without consent of the creator) remain on the IPFS              
network but do not appear on the Snip platform, and the writer is notified. Content               
contributors are asked to provide references for stories (if such a reference exists), and              
to decide on the percentage they want to share with the referenced publisher, with a               
10% minimum, a figure which is subject to future changes based on the discretion of               
the Snip company. Revenue sharing rewards original journalism and helps it flourish,            
especially once Snip becomes a large platform where many people get their news. The              
Snip company will share revenue with individual contributors, publishers or          
non-profits (such as Wikipedia) but not with corporations or governments that offer            
content for free. Of course, regardless of the Snip company’s policy, members of the              
community​ ​can​ ​reward​ ​tokens​ ​for​ ​content​ ​on​ ​their​ ​own​ ​terms. 

2.4.​ ​Personalization​ ​&​ ​Content​ ​Filtering 

The Snip platform is intended to be the most complete news source on any              
topic or current event. As a result, the volume of content will certainly be more than                
any single user can consume. The solution is a personal feed with customized content.              
The algorithm aims to reach a high ​hit rate​, meaning that the feed should contain a                
large percentage of articles which interest the reader. This enables high quality            
notifications,​ ​​ ​keeping​ ​users​ ​informed​ ​about​ ​the​ ​topics​ ​they​ ​value​ ​most.  

To reach a high hit rate, the content is personalized for each user using              
open-source algorithms, some developed by the Snip company and some by the            
community. Users choose their own preferred personalization algorithm when they          
register, and can change it at any time. They can follow favorite contributors, boosting              
them in the algorithm. By making the algorithms open source, as opposed to those of               
platforms like Facebook or Twitter, Snip ensures transparency and allows for the kind             
of constant improvement that only a community of contributors can achieve. In stark             
contrast to today’s news publishers, Snip has no editorial board and does not decide              
which​ ​stories​ ​are​ ​fit​ ​to​ ​print​ ​and​ ​which​ ​are​ ​not. 

To assist developers, Snip provides an API and publishes sample datasets to            
allow developers to test their own algorithms. The following is a partial list of features               
which​ ​are​ ​or​ ​will​ ​be​ ​available​ ​to​ ​developers: 

1. Post​ ​publish​ ​date. 
2. Text​ ​features​ ​-​ ​keywords,​ ​topic,​ ​length,​ ​etc. 
3. Reactions​ ​from​ ​similar​ ​users. 
4. Likes. 
5. Dislikes. 
6. Marked​ ​as​ ​spam. 
7. Comments. 

9 



 

8. A​ ​list​ ​of​ ​the​ ​user’s​ ​followed​ ​contributors. 
9. Contributors’​ ​metadata​ ​including​ ​number​ ​of​ ​followers,​ ​region,​ ​language,​ ​etc. 

The Snip company rewards developers for creating useful personalization algorithms          
with​ ​tokens​ ​reserved​ ​for​ ​that​ ​purpose.

Users need to feel safe when using the Snip platform. Therefore, along with             
choosing their preferred news feed personalization algorithm, users can add their own            
rules to filter out content that they prefer not to see. For example, users may choose not                 
to view content they believe to be fake news, or content deemed to be of poor quality                 
by​ ​community​ ​members​ ​they​ ​trust.​ ​This​ ​​ ​can​ ​be​ ​done​ ​in​ ​a​ ​few​ ​ways:: 

1. Blocking​ ​posts​ ​or​ ​comments​ ​from​ ​specific​ ​users. 
2. Blocking specific words (or word groups) from appearing in the personal           

newsfeed​ ​or​ ​notifications. 
3. Choosing a spam filter - users can choose their own spam filter (or no filter at                

all),​ ​in​ ​the​ ​same​ ​manner​ ​as​ ​the​ ​personalization​ ​algorithm. 

By default, these filters are not public so that each user’s privacy is protected. Of               
course, users can choose to share these filters publicly if they want, allowing others to               
utilize​ ​them. 

2.6.​ ​Encouraging​ ​Diverse,​ ​High-Quality​ ​Content 

Snip’s goal is to cover everything happening the world, but some things are             
much easier to write about than others. For instance, it may take a writer 30 seconds to                 
share a funny anecdote, whereas explaining a complicated scientific breakthrough in           
simple​ ​words​ ​could​ ​easily​ ​take​ ​the​ ​same​ ​writer​ ​30​ ​minutes.  

If the only incentive for content contributors is the number of clicks or likes,              
most of the content on the platform remains basic, easy-to-create content, and            
high-quality content is not rewarded. To avoid this, the Snip company uses a portion of               
the​ ​tokens​ ​as​ ​an​ ​incentive​ ​mechanism​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​manner: 

1. Rewarding scarce content - Tokens will be added to content categories that are             
poorly represented on the platform. If, for instance, there is a shortage in live              
sports coverage on the platform, bonus tokens will be rewarded specifically to            
live​ ​sports​ ​snips. 

2. Suggestions from readers - If readers express interest in an event or a news story,               
these requests are posted anonymously, and writers receive bonus tokens for           
writing​ ​a​ ​snip​ ​on​ ​the​ ​requested​ ​subject​ ​or​ ​story. 

Categories and reader suggestions are visible to everyone in the community           
and all writers have the opportunity to collect the bonus tokens by writing an engaging               
story. 

10 



 

To assist the news feed algorithms and the incentive systems, contributors are required             
to​ ​note​ ​the​ ​category​ ​of​ ​their​ ​snip.​ ​Some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​suggested​ ​categories​ ​are:  

● Breaking​ ​News 
● Science​ ​and​ ​Technology​ ​News 
● Politics​ ​Op/Ed 
● Live​ ​Sports 

Machine Learning algorithms can help contributors with the categorization and          
readers are encouraged to flag content if it is categorized incorrectly. An additional             
algorithm receives the writer’s decided category and user feedback and decides on the             
appropriate​ ​category.​ ​All​ ​algorithms​ ​are​ ​open-source​ ​and​ ​available​ ​to​ ​the​ ​community. 

2.7.​ ​Privacy 

User data is private and is never shared with third-parties. User votes are             
private​ ​and​ ​cannot​ ​be​ ​seen​ ​by​ ​anyone​ ​else,​ ​unless​ ​the​ ​user​ ​decides​ ​to​ ​share​ ​them. 

2.8.​ ​Snip​ ​and​ ​the​ ​Open​ ​Web 

The content published on the platform is searchable and available for everyone            
to read and does not require logging in or providing personal information, such as an               
email​ ​address​ ​or​ ​Facebook​ ​login.  

Professional content, intended for subscribers, will be locked to non-paying          
users.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​expected​ ​to​ ​be​ ​only​ ​a​ ​small​ ​minority​ ​of​ ​the​ ​content​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform. 

 

 

  

11 



 

3.​ ​Distribution​ ​&​ ​User​ ​Acquisition 
A major challenge in consumer media is distribution and user acquisition.           

Many media companies which create valuable content are unable to gain users at a low               
price, and high customer acquisition costs (CAC) combined with the low lifetime            
value (LTV) in the ads business, create unprofitable businesses. Therefore, creating a            
viral product is crucial to building a successful media company. In Snip, we’re             
applying three unique methods to solve this problem and to build a company which is               
consistently​ ​profitable. 

3.1.​ ​Referrals 

Users who refer their friends to the platform will receive a small token reward,              
helping to attract a critical mass of users to the platform. The referrers will only be                
rewarded if their friends become day-to-day users of the platform, substantially           
reducing the risk of gaming the system. The cost in tokens is expected to be               
significantly lower than ad spending since people are much more inclined to receive a              
friend’s referral than respond to advertisement. In addition, users will probably refrain            
from referring friends who won’t be interested in the product because those will not              
help​ ​them​ ​to​ ​gain​ ​tokens. 

3.2.​ ​Token​ ​Holder​ ​Promotion 

Token holders have a vested interest that the platform prospers and offers more             
content and services. Therefore, they are likely to promote the product to family and              
friends,​ ​without​ ​cost​ ​to​ ​the​ ​company. 

3.3.​ ​Discovery​ ​of​ ​Viral​ ​Content 

For the past 18 months, the Snip company has been collecting high-resolution            
data on the virality of content online, with a focus on social networks and news               
websites. Using this data, the company is applying Machine Learning technologies           
(NLP, statistical analyses, etc) to find topics which are most likely to gain traction in               
social networks. The topics will be recommended to our community of writers,            
allowing them to produce extremely viral content and collect token rewards. This            
technology​ ​has​ ​already​ ​proven​ ​itself​ ​in​ ​the​ ​current​ ​product. 

4.​ ​Business​ ​Model 
To keep the Snip ecosystem healthy and prosperous, Snip relies on a variety of              

income​ ​sources:  

1. Subscriptions 

2. Tipping 

3. Advertising 

4. Ad-free​ ​version 

12 



 

Users don’t like ads and the goal is to minimize the revenue from ads and focus                
on other revenue streams, but for the foreseeable future we expect our revenue to              
include all four of these sources. A majority of the revenue in each category goes to                
content contributors, further incentivizing people to create great content. The Snip           
company takes a small cut, allowing for hiring talent, product development, and            
day-to-day​ ​operations. 

4.1.​ ​Subscriptions 

Snip offers an engaging subscription service, paid for monthly, with tokens.           
Our first widespread offering is audio snips. Audio snips is a personalized feed of the               
stories users find most interesting, in audio form. Audio snips can replace or             
supplement listening to the news on the radio. This is aimed at commuters, people with               
disabilities, and anyone who enjoys listening to the news. This is projected to be a               
very​ ​popular​ ​offering. 

An additional subscription service Snip offers is a professional content stream,           
meaning summaries of technical developments in a specific field or profession. The            
professional content service can help users keep up-to-date in their professional field,            
whether it is cancer research, database technology, or South African politics. Some            
topics are, of course, geared towards a small niche market. The expectation is that              
these topics develop a devoted, if small, following. In this offering, the community can              
request professional content and offer payment, allowing writers will to supply the            
content​ ​that​ ​readers​ ​really​ ​need. 

It is important to note that these offerings are provided as streams, rather than              
dailies. 

4.2.​ ​Tipping 

Readers have the option of tipping content contributors for great posts or            
comments, similar to tipping on Reddit via Reddit Gold. The tipping is facilitated by              
tokens, allowing for small, cheap micro-payments. The content creator receives 97%           
of the tip, with only 3% going to the Snip company. This figure could change in the                 
future, upwards or downwards, based on the discretion of the Snip company. The             
company​ ​is​ ​incentivized​ ​to​ ​reward​ ​writers​ ​and​ ​keep​ ​the​ ​best​ ​writers​ ​in​ ​the​ ​platform. 

4.3.​ ​Advertising 

Snip has a duty to provide users with the most interesting and relevant             
advertisements as possible. Ads are native and are required to present content that             
provides value for users. Ads are visibly marked and users always know when they’re              
seeing an ad. Users can flag bad or misleading advertisements, and those ads and ad               
creators are policed and removed if necessary. Users can always see their advertising             
profile and understand why they are shown specific ads. User information is never             
provided​ ​to​ ​advertisers​ ​or​ ​other​ ​third​ ​parties.  

13 



 

4.4.​ ​Ad-free​ ​version 

Users are offered an ad-free version which is funded by a monthly subscription.             
Since ad income can be tenuous, and users often dislike advertisements, Snip hopes             
that​ ​most​ ​users​ ​will​ ​choose​ ​to​ ​go​ ​ad-free. 

 

 

  

14 



 

5.​ ​The​ ​Snip​ ​Token​ ​(SnipCoin) 
SnipCoin is the exclusive token of the Snip platform, and can be used both for               

rewarding​ ​content​ ​contributors​ ​and​ ​for​ ​rewards​ ​for​ ​the​ ​various​ ​services.  

The total number of SnipCoins is 10,000,000,000 (ten billion), minted in           
advance.​ ​The​ ​Snip​ ​company​ ​rewards​ ​contributors​ ​with​ ​SnipCoins​ ​from​ ​two​ ​sources: 

1. An initial pool of 2,100,000,000 SnipCoins designated in the token sale (to be             
detailed in this paper). The initial amount of weekly SnipCoins is 15,500,000,            
and will decrease by 57,500 SnipCoins every week, until reaching 0 over 267             
weeks​ ​(5​ ​years).  

2. The platform’s revenue - A large portion of the platform’s revenue (in            
SnipCoins) is added to the pool, and a small cut of the revenue is passed on to                 
the​ ​Snip​ ​company. 

Revenue from subscriptions and ads is expected to increase over time as the network              
grows, and its share out of the total pool size will constantly grow. Eventually the               
share of pre-allocated SnipCoins is expected to become negligible, as demonstrated in            
the​ ​chart​ ​below.

7.​ ​Business​ ​Landscape 

7.1.​ ​Competition 

Snip’s competitors can be divided into two main categories - news publishers            
and​ ​social​ ​networks. 

7.1.1.​ ​News​ ​Publishers 

Publishers like Fox, CNN, and the New York Times manage large newsrooms            
where journalists create content guided by editors. The created content is then            
presented on their website, mobile app, and in some cases, a TV network. These              
platforms do not host user-generated content and their news stories are moderated by a              
small group of editors. Often their content is longer than necessary, allowing them to              
fit​ ​more​ ​ads​ ​into​ ​each​ ​article. 

7.1.2.​ ​Social​ ​Networks 

Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit are based on user-generated content but do not            
reward contributors for the value they produce. Facebook is less focused on news             
compared to Reddit and Twitter, which are used by many as news platforms. A major               
problem with both platforms is that the news stories are provided as links, without              
enough relevant information. Advertising cannot be controlled in this situation. Snip,           
instead,​ ​provides​ ​short​ ​snippets​ ​with​ ​all​ ​the​ ​relevant​ ​content.  

Steem is a Reddit-like social network in which content creators are rewarded            
for their publications, but users usually don’t create news stories and the platform is              
hardly​ ​used​ ​by​ ​mainstream​ ​users.  

7.2.​ ​Snip​ ​Advantages 

7.2.1.​ ​Decentralized 

In contrast to mainstream publishers and social networks, the Snip network is            
decentralized and owned by the community, with all the content saved openly on the              
IPFS network. Content cannot be censored and users on the Snip website choose their              
personal​ ​news​ ​feed​ ​algorithm. 

7.2.2.​ ​News-oriented 

Snip is a place for people to read news and discuss the news stories they care                
about. Snip covers a wide variety of topics, allowing users to stay up-to-date on their               
favorite​ ​topics​ ​in​ ​a​ ​shorter,​ ​more​ ​efficient​ ​format. 

7.2.3.​ ​User-generated​ ​content 

The news stories on the platform are created by the community and users             
receive the vast majority of the reward for high-quality posts and comments, as             
decided​ ​by​ ​the​ ​community. 

17 



 

7.2.4.​ ​Personalization 

In contrast to mainstream publishers, the content on Snip is personalized for            
each user. When two different people access the platform, they see two different feeds,              
based​ ​on​ ​their​ ​personal​ ​preferences. 

7.2.5.​ ​Ad-free​ ​option 

Many users don’t like ads, and some are willing to pay for an ad-free              
experience. In contrast to Facebook and Twitter, Snip gives users the option to             
subscribe to an ad-free version, and users know that their payment goes directly to              
content​ ​creators.  

 

 

  

18 



 

8.​ ​Crowdsale 
To raise the funds required to continue platform development and maintenance,           

a​ ​SnipCoin​ ​crowdsale​ ​will​ ​be​ ​held​ ​on​ ​September​ ​29th,​ ​2017,​ ​at​ ​23:00​ ​UTC.. 
● Our goal is to raise ​$8 million USD ​(hard cap). Upon reaching the goal the sale                

will​ ​stop​ ​and​ ​no​ ​more​ ​contributions​ ​will​ ​be​ ​accepted. 
● The minimum goal for the crowdsale is ​$0.8 million USD ​(soft cap).            

Contributors​ ​will​ ​be​ ​refunded​ ​if​ ​the​ ​goal​ ​isn’t​ ​reached.  
● The​ ​duration​ ​of​ ​the​ ​sale​ ​will​ ​be​ ​no​ ​more​ ​than​ ​​30​ ​days​.  
● 10 billion SnipCoins (SNP) will be minted, of which ​80% are designated to             

the community and the contributors​. The initial distribution of tokens will           
be: 

○ 28%​ ​is​ ​available​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale​. 
○ 30%​ ​will​ ​be​ ​sold​ ​in​ ​the​ ​future​ ​token​ ​sale​ ​and​ ​will​ ​be​ ​locked​ ​for​ ​3​ ​years.  
○ 21% is reserved for the initial pool of contributor rewards. This is kept             

in a time-locked vault and released every month according to the           
amount transferred to the contributors during that month, with a hard           
limit of 90,000,000 SNP. A portion of the contributor reward pool is            
reserved for community developers (bug bounties, contributing       
algorithms,​ ​etc). 

○ 20.5% is designated for the Snip company and will be used internally            
and for advisors and partner companies. Snip employees and founders          
will not hold tokens prior to the sale and will not be rewarded with              
tokens in the first 6 months after the sale. In the period of 6 to 12                
months after the sale, Snip employees and founders will be rewarded           
with​ ​no​ ​more​ ​than​ ​4%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​total​ ​tokens. 

○ 0.5% is designated for the Snip bounty, helping to spread the word            
about​ ​the​ ​Snip​ ​platform​ ​before​ ​the​ ​crowdsale. 

19 



 

 

● Exchange​ ​rate: 
○ The current exchange rate is ​1 ETH = 76K SnipCoins (SNP). Since            

the price of Ethereum fluctuates, the official ETH/SNP conversion rate          
will be announced publicly a day before the sale. Unless Snip provides            
an official update of the ETH/SNP conversion rate, the conversion rate           
will​ ​stay​ ​constant​ ​during​ ​the​ ​sale​ ​period. 

● The​ ​sale​ ​will​ ​start​ ​on​ ​September​ ​29th,​ ​2017,​ ​23:00​ ​UTC 

 

  

20 



 

9.​ ​Budget​ ​Allocation 
The following charts shows a breakdown of the planned allocation of funds            

raised in the token sale. The values may change over time due to unexpected              
developments. Specifically, legal costs could grow significantly and take a larger share            
of​ ​the​ ​pie. 

 

● Platform Development - Most of the funds are used for building the platform:             
web and mobile applications, tools for content creators, personalization         
algorithms,​ ​and​ ​other​ ​necessities. 

● Sales & Marketing - Funds used for creating brand awareness and attracting            
the​ ​best​ ​writers​ ​to​ ​the​ ​platform.  

● Internal Content Creators - The Snip company hires content creators to           
ensure constant news coverage and topic diversity. This is a bootstrapping           
technique​ ​that​ ​is​ ​required​ ​mainly​ ​in​ ​the​ ​early​ ​stages​ ​of​ ​the​ ​platform. 

● Administration - Funds used for ensuring platform security, hiring legal          
counsel,​ ​and​ ​other​ ​day-to-day​ ​administrative​ ​operations. 

● Reserves​ ​​-​ ​Additional​ ​funds​ ​reserved​ ​for​ ​unexpected​ ​expenditures.

10.​ ​Frequently​ ​Asked​ ​Questions 
What’s​ ​Snip? 

Snip is a decentralized, user-generated news platform where anyone can write a news             
story (or “snip”) about a topic of their choice, and read news on the issues they care                 
about. The platform has no editor deciding what’s fit to print and the decision is made                
solely​ ​by​ ​the​ ​community.  

What​ ​does​ ​the​ ​name​ ​mean? 

The word Snip is derived from the word snippet. We have found that users prefer short                
snippets of high-quality information to long, articles, which often contain more filler            
than​ ​information. 

What​ ​are​ ​the​ ​Snip​ ​tokens?​ ​What​ ​can​ ​token​ ​holders​ ​do​ ​with​ ​them? 

SnipCoin is the exclusive token of the Snip platform, and can be used for both               
rewarding content contributors and paying for the various services. The tokens are sold             
only for use on the Snip platform and do not provide equity or rights in the Snip                 
company. A Snip token is not a security and is not recommended for speculators of               
any kind. Do not purchase tokens if you don’t thoroughly understand the concepts of              
cryptographic tokens, token sales, and blockchain technology, and purchase them only           
if you plan to use the tokens to consume Snip services. If the crowdsale reaches the                
minimum​ ​amount​ ​(noted​ ​below),​ ​then​ ​the​ ​tokens​ ​are​ ​not​ ​refundable​ ​once​ ​delivered. 

When​ ​will​ ​the​ ​crowdsale​ ​begin? 

The crowdsale is expected to start in September and last until the earlier of 30 days, or                 
until $8M are collected. An official date will be announced at least 10 days before the                
beginning​ ​of​ ​the​ ​crowdsale. 

How​ ​much​ ​is​ ​being​ ​sold​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale? 

The crowdsale goal is to sell $8M, with a minimum sell of $800K. If $800K isn’t sold,                 
the​ ​transferred​ ​funds​ ​will​ ​be​ ​returned​ ​to​ ​buyers. 

What​ ​currencies​ ​are​ ​accepted​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale? 

The accepted currencies will be announced at least 10 days before the beginning of the               
crowdsale. 

What​ ​will​ ​the​ ​funds​ ​be​ ​used​ ​for? 

As detailed in section ​9, the money is expected to be used mainly for platform

Yes, Snip tokens are transferable and are not in control of the Snip company.              
As described in this white paper, some of the tokens are locked in time-vaults, a               
measure​ ​applied​ ​to​ ​protect​ ​the​ ​token​ ​buyers.
