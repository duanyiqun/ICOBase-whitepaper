1. INTRODUCTION

Today, lottery is the largest social and entertainment game in the world. The share 
of lotteries on the world’s gambling market is over 30 %. The annual turnover of 
this market today is $284 billion. Along with the penetration of the Internet and 
the growing number of devices connected to a network, the number of users who 
prefer playing this game online is growing. Consequently, the online lottery market 
today is promising area. 

But despite such popularity, the lotteries currently present on the market cannot 
provide the user with a 100 % guarantee of an honest lottery or offer full transparen-
cy with regard to the formation and distribution of the prize fund. It is not surprising 
that this issue is a hot topic for discussion on forums and in private conversations 
among amateurs who like try their fortune in this game. Unfortunately, at present 
one can see licensed operators periodically caught in various sorts of violations re-
garding prize fund distribution and the honesty of the lottery. Just as important are 
the conditions for receiving awards, which also have a number of shortcomings in 
the form of delayed payments and various kinds of commissions.

Now, thanks to smart contracts, we have the ability to address these critical issues. 
KIBO is a decentralized lottery, the main advantage of which is the complete trans-
parency of all processes taking place on the platform and the fundamental absence 
of opportunities for fraud. Unlike “fair play checks”, which allow one to check game 
results in existing cryptocurrency lotteries, KIBO itself eliminates the potential for 
fraud. This is made possible by Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts. The 
marketing component of the lottery is also implemented based on smart contracts, 
allowing franchise partners and owners of KIBIT tokens to be sure of receiving their 
earnings and the correctness of its calculation. 

KIBO is a platform where all processes are implemented and managed by smart 
contracts. Ticket purchase, random number generation, and prize payouts, as well 
as accruals in the distributed partner network, are performed by a smart contract 
without the possibility of intervention by third parties.   Changes in the platform are 
made by a vote of control token holders

KIBO Whitepaper

ETHEREUM AS THE BASIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

For implementation of the project, the Ethereum [2] decentralized network, which 
uses the concept of “smart contracts”, was chosen. Ethereum has great potential 
for scaling [3] and the broad support of the cryptocommunity and investors. Cur-
rently, the network is theoretically capable of handling about 10 transactions per 
second; this is enough to start project implementation.

Methods for network scaling presented in the above-mentioned report [3] will make 
it possible to accept more than 50 million users in the near future.

2. The KIBO framework

Currently, Ethereum infrastructure cannot yet offer a complete solution which in-
cludes the decentralized part of the interface (the required functionality will appear 
at the Metropolis stage. An excerpt from Ethereum’s official blog [5]:

As it is not yet possible to decentralize the application interface itself at the mo-
ment, the KIBO project is implemented partially in a server infrastructure which con-
tains standard solutions for such cases, as well as a specialized application based 
on smart contracts. In parallel with the work on the server solution, we are working 
on various options for decentralizing the interface part, including our own solution.



KIBO Whitepaper 04

3. The contract scheme.

The KIBO Ethereum infrastructure is a set of contracts which interact with each 
other according to the scheme below:

At the initial stages of the platform’s work, contracts in the system can be replaced 
(by the voting of control tokens, which at this stage are in the team of KIBO devel-
opers). Upon completion of the test and development stages, the relations between 
contracts will be recorded and subsequent changes in contracts and their relation-
ships will not be possible.

A. Managing contract

The contract which coordinates the interaction of all other KIBO contracts, such 
as lotteries or voting contracts. New user registration, lottery ticket purchases and 
implementation of decisions adopted in a voting contract are performed by means 
of referencing the managing contract.



KIBO Whitepaper 05

B. Repository

 repository contract is used to store data about users, franchisee partners and their 
relationships. It should be noted that the contract only stores anonymous data that 
are not linked to the user’s identity (the user is defined by his/her alias and wallet), 
so any system user can be completely anonymous.

Modification of certain data in the repository is only possible from the managing 
contract; the central contract address is determined by voting of control token hold-
ers.

struct K_Users_User {
uint shareholder; // if user is shareholder 
uint big; // amount of kibits 2 user
uint small; // if user is partner
uint partner_type; // 0 - new, 1 - registered before platform start
string username; // login
uint[8] partner_parents; // parents-partners structure for 7 levels
uint[8] partner_parents_level; // user have %q% partners at level of 7
uint[8] player_parents; // parents-players structure for 7 levels
uint[8] player_parents_level;  // user have %q% players at level of 7
}

C. Voting contract

A contract that stores a list of issues for the management of all contracts, as well as 
the conditions for making decisions on these issues. The voting and decision-mak-
ing system is implemented such as to allow the development of the platform and 
the addition of new games to KIBO’s functionality without the possibility of interven-
tion in the algorithms for accrual and work with the customer base of the separate 
branch of each partner. Only control token holders have the right to vote in this 
contract.

struct K_Ballot_Type {
string theme;
uint quorum;
uint need;
uint length;

//  issue text
//  quorum for decision-making as a %
//  % for decision-making
//  voting duration (seconds)

}



KIBO Whitepaper 06

4. Contract management

Contract management is carried out by voting of control token holders. The list of 
issues and the decision-making conditions for each of them is initially set in the 
contract. Any control token holder can initiate voting on any issue in the list and 
vote.  Voting results are accepted in the case of a positive vote of 30 % to 51 % of 
control token holders, depending on the importance and impact on the subsequent 
development and operation of the KIBO platform of the issue put to vote.

To further stimulate voting activity, the following mechanism has been implement-
ed: accrual of remuneration per token upon voting is carried out immediately after a 
control token holder votes. The amount of remuneration for all 10,000 tokens is 1 % 
of turnover from all platform lotteries.

When tickets are purchased, funds are distributed as follows

Branch bonus: 17%

Payout on KIBITS: 14%

Payout on control tokens: 1%
Lottery prize fund: 68%



KIBO Whitepaper 07

Payout for the KIBO 
PLATFORM franchisee 

branch network
10 %

For payout of bonus-
es for the line-by-line 
branch network. 7 %
 distributed upwards, 

1 % per level.

Payout on KIBIT 
tokens 
14 %

Deferred payout on 
control tokens

1 %

Prize fund formation 
68 %

5. Tokens

The KIBO platform has several different types of tokens, each of which has its own 
set of features and an expanded incentive system. All Payouts and accruals of re-
muneration in the branch network and all types of tokens are triggered when tickets 
are purchased (this is the most frequent action in the system). Payouts of prizes to 
players are also triggered by this and in one more way described below in the “Pay-
out” section. All platform tokens are not KIBO internal currency and are not intended 
for internal settlements in the system. All payouts and remunerations are made 
directly to the user’s wallet in ETH cryptocurrency.

KIBO control token 10,000 units are intended for contract management. It allows 
one to put issues to a vote (voting contract) or vote on an issue. To further stimulate 
voting activity, 1 % (in ETH cryptocurrency) from the total turnover of all lotteries 
connected to the KIBO system is accrued to all 10,000 tokens. Accrual of remu-
neration takes place at all times; however, the actual payout to the user’s wallet is 
carried out only at the moment a control token holder votes. Thus, we strengthen 
the motivation to vote, even for minority holders of control tokens.

At the initial stage, control tokens will be distributed among the managing partners. 
In the future, all or part of the control tokens may be distributed among a large num-
ber of partners interested in the project’s development and growth. These are major 
holders of KIBIT tokens or owners of platforms with large client bases.



KIBO Whitepaper

This mechanism is incorporated in the smart contract algorithm in order to transfer 
contract management to a decentralized basis in the future.

KIBIT token: The KIBO platform’s main investment asset. There are a total of 350 
million tokens, to which 14 % of total turnover from all platform lotteries is accrued. 

08

As part of the marketing strategy, at the crowd-sale stage 100 million KIBIT tokens 
will be distributed, to which 4 % of turnover will be allocated. The remaining 250 mil-
lion are owned by the development team and will form the company’s income and 
will be used at the team’s discretion, including for further platform development, 
options within the team, and other strategic decisions. 

Tokens not sold during the sale remain under the control of the managing partners. 
Income generated by these tokens may be
sent to a specific address by voting.

KIBO PLATFORM token: Allows one to become a KIBO branch owner and receive 
the respective bonus for the expansion of the client network and building of a 
branch network. All operations and payouts of remuneration in the operation of 
KIBO branches are guaranteed by a smart contract. There a total of 20,000 base 
(Kibo Platform) tokens

The branch owner receives 10 % from all tickets purchased by clients invited by him 
5 levels deep



KIBO Whitepaper 09

Also, the KIBO platform’s functionality incorporates the possibility of expanding 
one’s own branch network by sending registration links and platform recommen-
dations at the time of the crowdsale. When there are such networks, additional 
accruals from each of these platforms will be 10 % from the income of all partner 
branches up to the 7th level.

Thus, 17 % will be paid out from the purchase of each ticket to stimulate the devel-
opment of the client network and branch network. 10 % from ticket sales is paid out 
to the client base owner, and 7 % is allocated among 7 levels upwards, 1 % each, for 
payout to higher branches, which is equal to 10 % of the partner’s income at each 
level.

6. Integrated marketing tool to promote continuous
platform growth

The user can participate in promotions and draws which are present on the KIBO 
LOTTO platform. Any player can invite other players to the platform using his own 
link and receive 5 % of the invited players’ winnings on a constant basis. This mech-
anism is also managed by a smart contract and is part of a marketing strategy 
called “game with friends”. Receipt of winnings from a game with friends is gov-
erned by the following rules:

To receive 5 % of the winnings of invited players: 

At level 1 you must have bought 1 ticket for this draw 
At level 2 you must have bought 3 tickets for this draw
At level 3 you must have bought 7 tickets for this draw

Thus, the player is interested in inviting other players, because
every invited person will greatly increase the chances of winning in each draw. 

Promotion

An important marketing component embedded in the KIBO platform smart con-
tract is the proper motivation of each client at all levels of development, both for 
ordinary users and for the platform owners. 

In the promotional draws, which will continue for three months after the platform 
launch, everyone can take part in a series of free draws with large cash prizes. This 
promotion is aimed at expanding the client base of each branch and KIBO LOTTO 
as a whole. Each player, as part of this promotion, will be able to give his friends the 
opportunity to participate in this series of draws. The free tickets received by a play-
er as a gift win only if 6 numbers are matched. As in the “Game with friends” mecha-
nism, if a player at one of the three levels below another player wins, the latter player 
receives 5 % of the amount won by the former player.  To obtain this bonus, it is not 
necessary to buy tickets; the player needs only activate his free tickets for this draw. 



KIBO Whitepaper

Free ticket activation and protection against bots.

To reduce the risk of possible bot attacks during free draws, free ticket activation 
for a new player is carried out through balance refill in an amount of $1 or more. 
After that, a restriction on cash withdrawal is set and funds in the amount of $1 
cannot be withdrawn, but are at the user’s disposal. They are available for purchase 
of tickets for participation in any paid draws that are held on the platform along with 
the promotions. The user can withdraw any amount above $1 at any time. Once this 
account has purchased 3 tickets on the platform, the restriction is automatically 
removed, and from that point on the user can withdraw all the funds and zero out 
the balance.  Thus, a bot attack becomes very costly and is comparable to simple 
participation in the lottery, but for larger amounts.

Prize fund formation and distribution.

68 % of a ticket purchase is allocated to prize fund formation. 

Comments:  Since we have tickets from which payouts for the partner and client 
bonus do not come entirely, as they fall within the area of non-distribution, there is 
always a remainder. This remainder is always used to replenish the current draw 
prize fund. This means that in fact the percentage used for prize fund formation is 
different each time and is always greater than 68 %. Let us take the initial 68 % as 
the basis for the description. These funds are intended for payouts related to the 
lottery and distributed according to the reserve funds system within the contract as 
follows

11



KIBO Whitepaper 12

10% are deposited to the “reserve fund”, from which a guaranteed minimum jackpot 
is formed for the next draw, if a jackpot is to be awarded in the current draw.  

13.5% are used for the formation of a fund from which 5 % are paid three levels 
upwards if a player with players above that invited him wins. Part of these funds will 
not be spent each time after draw completion. For example, if a player who has only 
one player above him wins. In this case, 10 % will not be paid to anyone. After each 
draw, the unclaimed remainder from this fund is automatically sent to the “reserve 
fund” of this lottery. 

76.5% are used for the formation of the prize fund, from which the jackpot and oth-
er prizes are formed.

Next, 2 of the 4 lotteries presented on the platform at launch are
described as an example.

Lottery 6/49

76.5 % of funds received for the formation of the prize payout fund in the lottery 
6/49 are allocated as follows.

First of all, 48  % goes towards jackpot formation. By directing the funds from a 
purchased ticket to increase the jackpot first of all, we always know the jackpot size 
even before the draw and we can reflect its increase in proportion with ticket sales. 
Other prizes are formed after draw completion from the remaining 52 % as follows.  

Fixed prizes are calculated first 

Tickets that guessed 2 main balls are first. These players receive a prize in 
an amount equal to the ticket price.

Next, those who guessed 2 main balls + bonus ball receive their payout. The 
amount of the payout is 1.7 times the ticket price.

Next, those who guessed 3 main balls receive their payout. The amount of 
the payout is 3 times the ticket price.

The remaining funds are allocated among those who guessed 4 numbers or more 
in the following order:

4 main balls 57 %
5 main balls + bonus ball 16 %
5 main balls 27 %



KIBO Whitepaper 13

For example: 10 players guessed 5 balls; 27 % is allocated among them in equal 
shares.

Jackpot increase

If in the current draw the jackpot is not won, the jackpot funds (48 %) go to increase 
the next jackpot. That is, we take the 48 % and add them to the amount that is 
allocated for the jackpot from the ticket sales for the next draw. Thus, the jackpot 
continues to grow until it is won. Once the jackpot is won, the contract accesses 
the reserve fund and withdraws the amount for the minimum guaranteed jackpot, 
which increases from ticket sales according to the same scheme. 

General points  
A lottery contract is intended for conducting a lottery and
storage of its draw results. Only the last 8 draws + the current
draw are stored.

Every time a ticket is purchased, the user transmits a random set of data  
(automatically generated by frontend by default)

To generate random numbers, a combination of several factors is used:

After completion of the draw, the contract takes hashes of every other block 
out of the 14 blocks after draw completion and mixes them with the ran-
dom data from users.



KIBO Whitepaper 14

JokerBall lottery

In the JokerBall lottery, unlike in 6/49, the winning combination takes into account 
not only the digit, but also its position in the number. The JACKPOT is fixed and is 
allocated among the winners in the following way:

Coincidence Prize

2 0.0003 % of the Jackpot per one ticket

3 0.0006 % of the Jackpot per one ticket

4 0.005 % of the Jackpot per one ticket

5 0.05% of the Jackpot per one ticket

6 2 % of the Jackpot per one ticket, but not morethan 100 %

7 100 % of the Jackpot on all tickets

Random number generation is similar to that for lottery 6/49. The lottery scheme is 
also identical to that for lottery 6/49

 // generate 7 numbers (6 + 1 bonus number) 
 function generateResult() private {
  if (game - 1 > 0) {
   uint counter = 1;
   uint tmp_num = 0;
   for (uint i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter);
    while(!checkResult(tmp_num)) {
     tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter);
     counter += 1;
    }
    result[game - 1][i] = tmp_num;
   }
   result[game - 1][6] = generateResultNum(game - 1, 7, counter);
  } 
 }

 // ...
 
 // When drawing is ended, we remember the block.number
 // Then we wait 50 blocks;
 // Then using this remembered block we start to generate 7 numbers each second block back
 // starting from remembered block + 30
 // After all it is several blocks ahead from drawing end and several blocks behind current
 function generateResultNum(uint _game, uint _index, uint _counter) constant private returns 
(uint) {
  uint num = 0;
  uint last_block = game_stats[_game].gameendblock + 30;
  num = ((uint160(sha3(block.blockhash(last_block - _index * 2), user_random[_game]
[uint160(sha3(block.blockhash(last_block - _index * 2))) % user_random[_game].length])) * _counter) % 
49) + 1;
  return num;
 }



KIBO Whitepaper

7. Payout of winnings

Due to the technical limitations of the ETHEREUM network at the moment, payouts 
of winnings are made at the user’s request (a click on the button in the user inter-
face next to the corresponding draw).

Due to the fact that in order to make the payout, a large number of records in the 
contract must be sorted (since payouts on some matches are made as a percent-
age, that is, they depend on the number of people who guessed the given combina-
tion), the payout is not made immediately, but only after sorting all the necessary 
data.

For one user’s payout request, 100 tickets are sorted; after all the tickets have been 
sorted,  the actual payout to all users is launched by clicking the “payout” button 
(100 payouts per click). Payouts are made only to those users who have clicked the 
“payout” button. 

Thus, in order to complete sorting and payouts on all the tickets, one out of fifty 
users who purchased a ticket needs to take his winnings. As the Ethereum network 
scales up, the number of tickets sorted in a single operation will increase.

8. Conclusion

This document presents a part of the technological and marketing solutions that 
are planned in the process of the KIBO platform’s development. Also, as the Ethe-
reum blockchain improves, we will actively use emerging network capabilities that 
will make KIBO the most reliable and extensive decentralized lottery in the world, 
and will provide an opportunity to all those who joined the platform at the starting 
period to share our success. 

9. Roadmap

The launch of the KIBO platform will take place in the following stages:

1. BTC: Launch of the lottery on Bitcoin, Presale.
2. Start: Implementation of work on Ethereum franchisee account contracts,

two lotteries. Start of token sales.
3. Go: Start of two additional lotteries
4. Work: System market launch, fixing of contracts.
5. GUI: Decentralization of lottery user interface (Mist)
