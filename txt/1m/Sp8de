Introduction

Welcome to Sp8de, a blockchain-based platform capable of supplying unbiased public randomness for 

developing and running distributed casino applications. Sp8de is designed to suit the purposes of all the 

actors comprising the online casino landscape and as such represents the new breed of digital institutions, a 

distributed intermediary. 

The spark that lit this project and continues to inspire us now, is that early blockchain and Bitcoin casinos 

simply didn’t get it right. The Blockchain community was younger and wilder, ideals of distributed freedom 

were burning brighter… still, early adopters who applied blockchain technology to gambling promoted the 

wrong ideals; those undermining the image of decentralized casinos. Instead of promoting transparency and 

cost efficiency that characterize blockchain technology, they promoted anonymity and cyber anarchy. Instead 

of making the casino for everyone, they kept it to themselves. 

By no means are we here to judge. Instead, we are here to change. We do not say that old ways are bad, but can 

prove that new ones are better. We hold faith in the decentralized future and appreciate the charm of gambling. 

We soon realized that there is only a fragile wall of glass between the old centralized gambling and the future 

global distributed casino. This is it, a simple yet captivating idea. The future is here: we can run a zero-house 

edge decentralized casino with close-to-zero transaction fees and provably fair random numbers feeding 

entropy into a myriad of Smart-Contract-based open source casino applications that can be developed by 

anyone who has a worthy idea by means of state-of-the art application-specific as well general-purpose 

programming languages. “We can” was the silent voice of the idea. Now it is the marching echo of “we do”.

As it frequently happens, technological progress made a massive leap forward that went unnoticed by the 

majority of human kind: people still prefer the traditional narrow-minded and boring online casinos that set 

draconian house edges and cannot be proven fair. Once again, no one has the right to judge: it is just an 

existential business need, produced by a dilapidated business model and an inch of greed. 

Worse than this, however, is that even the enlightened ones, those chosen to witness the dawn of the distributed 

world have noticed a perfect fit between distributed consensus protocols and gambling applications, have 

synthesized them and… nothing. Some of these projects got infamous due to money laundering accusations, 

some have spoiled the beauty of the idea by running centralized online casinos and simply allowing for 

cryptocurrency deposits, others got their moments of fame during TGAs, today, however, few can recall even 

the names of these projects. Of course, there are some notable exceptions to this rule, but while succeeding 

locally all these projects have failed to create awareness. None of them has broadcasted the essential message: 

“There is no glass wall; the future of gambling is now; we are better in every single quantifiable aspect; if 

quantifiable is not enough, we also have the powerful idea of the distributed future, while those who are stuck 

in the past have only a couple of servers and an unaudited poker protocol”.

We will do what no one has done before. Sp8de is a blockchain-based platform for developing distributed 

gambling applications. As a platform for gambling applications with self-respect, we are equipped with the 

protocol for generating fresh unbiased public randomness. As a team with some aspirations we have it provably 

fair and completely decentralized. We feel that it is important to be true to the spirit of the venture we embark 

upon: if blockchain is the universal and undisputed source of truth then it should also be the broadcast channel 

for randomness. We think that single points of failure should be perceived by anyone as just a relic of the past.

This feature, while setting us aside most starkly, is only a part of what we have to offer in terms of technological 

stack. In what follows we will dive deeper into the revolution we all are a part of and will explain in detail the best 

iGaming protocol the world has ever seen. 

Industry overview

In the European Union the online gambling industry grew nearly 19% from the first half of 2015 until the first 

half of 2016. The casino industry in particular generated over US$2 billion in revenues during this period. It is 

expected that until 2020 this number will reach US$2.25 billion per year representing about 12.5% revenue 

growth [1]. In the US for the period 2015 until 2016 online casino revenues increased by 24.4% and are expected 

to reach US$4 billion by 2020 [2]. The EU and the US are just a small part of the worldwide casino industry. 

Globally, the projections of the online casino show that for the period 2017-2025 the market will experience 

growth of about 130% reaching US$97 billion with cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 11%. Currently over 

6 million adults are officially participating in gambling activities around the world with projections of reaching 

10 million by 2020 [3].

Since inception, the blockchain technology was the subject of close attention by gambling enthusiasts. Recent 

news from The Merkle [4] show how popular online Bitcoin betting has become. In aggregate the wagers put 

on online Bitcoin casinos in February 2017 have reached nearly 3 Bitcoin per minute. The price of Bitcoin at the 

end of February was about US$1,200 while now it is US$5,900 (approximately 292% growth) which means that 

as of today almost US$715 million worth of Bitcoin was gambled in February alone.

Figure 2 Google Trends “Bitcoin Casino” vs “Online Casino”

In Figure 1 we show how an investment of US$1 would have developed from 2010 until 2017 if it was invested into 

the giants of the online gambling industry1 [5] as compared to the same dollar being invested in Bitcoin. Apart 

from the fact that this investment in BTC would have provided US$70,502 as compared to only $US7.37 when 

invested in the index, one major observation can be made: the shaded areas show that as the Bitcoin blockchain 

technology was becoming more and more popular (that is the price of Bitcoin was rising) the traditional online 

casinos have also gained steam. However, when we look further in Figure 2 (Google Trends search for “Bitcoin 

Casino” and “Online Casino”) we see that the popularity of online casinos has been relatively stable and slowly 

declining since 2004. Only since the beginning of 2016 when the Bitcoin casinos have started to gain wide 

popularity did the online casinos see slight increase in interest. In addition, the search “Bitcoin Casino” has 

skyrocketed since May 2017 when it surpassed the search term “Online Casinos”. Furthermore, we know of 

the existence of at least ten relatively sound blockchain-driven casino projects that have entered the industry 

through a successful TGE and are still being developed.  Although somewhat broad2, this overview points out 

to an important pattern which holds a lot of relevance for the future of the gambling industry. 

Currently, online casinos seem to be only weakly affected by the growth in the interest in Bitcoin gambling and 

the blockchain-based casinos that at the moment appear to at least complement traditional online gambling. 

However, this is happening at a staggering pace and the tendency shows a possibility of blockchain-based 

gambling taking over online casinos. If the current pace of technological advancement of the blockchain 

industry is sustained, soon there will be no benefits left for the consumers in the more traditional online casinos.

1 To form this index, we create an equally-weighted portfolio of 888 Holdings, bet-at-home.com, GVC Holdings, Ladbrokes 
Coral Group, and MGM Resorts (although Bitcoin is traded during the weekends and holidays we only consider trading 
days).

2 When replacing “Online Casino” with “Online Gambling” the results are similar. Also replacing “Bitcoin Casino” with 
“Blockchain Casino” does not alter our results significantly. The results of searching “Ethereum Casino” are also similar to 
those of searching “Blockchain Casino”. Nevertheless, one has to consider that it is possible that people searching these 
keywords did not look for actual blockchain-based casino but rather that they want to gamble cryptocurrency such as 
Bitcoin.

The Blockchain and the Casino

In what follows we describe a protocol for decentralized blockchain platform for developing casino applications 

with multiple unique features whose solid implementation is lacking in any of the currently existing projects in 

this space. The concept of decentralized consensus that lies at the heart of blockchain is based on the smart 

application of cryptography and game-theory. Combined, they create the economics of trust and hold immense 

potential for revolutionizing many classic industries. 

This backbone of blockchain technology renders it an obvious candidate to consider in developing online 

gambling applications as, arguably, trust considerations and the need for transparency are - and always used to 

be - two major cornerstones of the gambling industry [6], [7], [8], [9]. In particular, blockchain has the potential 

to provide transparency to all transactions, drastically reduce the house edge, nearly eliminate transaction 

costs, ensure anonymity of participants and ultimately, create the trust among players and other industry 

participants. This rapidly evolving technological stack offers immense potential for improvements in the online 

gambling space, however, it also carries multiple new pitfalls that are scarcely (if at all) researched and poorly 

understood. To understand the benefits the blockchain brings, one needs to delve deep in the economics of 

casinos (the institutional viewpoint). Appreciating the challenges requires an overview of the mechanics of the 

blockchain technology. 

So, why would applying blockchain to online gambling appeal to an average person?  

   Economics of Gambling: An Institutional Perspective
While being driven throughout its long history by complex economic and sociological changes, the gambling 

industry has dramatically changed its competitive and institutional landscape – on the supply side it has 

changed remarkably little from the perspective of a person who wishes to try one’s luck. Indeed, it is still the 

same set of games that dominates the casino landscape, it is still the chance that defines one’s faith and these 

are still the classic transaction costs that interfere into the process, owing to the fact that the world we live in 

is not frictionless. 

It follows that we can view the casinos from the perspective of institutional economics, a branch of economics 

studying the impact of institutions on the behavior of economic actors. 

One of the major roles the financial institutions play, in modern economics, is economizing on transaction costs, 

thereby facilitating financial transactions that would otherwise be unfeasible. They also serve as escrows, 

notorious trusted third parties, who facilitate trust among the participants allowing them to enter into an 

exchange more efficiently than would otherwise be the case [10]. 

In this vein, casinos act as “gambling” intermediaries realizing the economies of scale, maintaining order and 

quality of service, thereby facilitating the “conditional” transactions – bets. 

Let’s imagine the evolution of the gambling industry as a path towards reducing the transaction costs where 

innovative industry newcomers attempt to take a piece of the overall pie from the old incumbents by bringing 

gambling closer to the frictionless ideal. 

In this vein, classic casinos reduce security and search costs, facilitate standardization by using chips and having 

house rules and, most importantly, realize economies of scale by bringing together people united by the shared 

desire to gamble. Following this line of reasoning, online casinos while performing the same functions as their 

classic brick-and-mortar counterparts, also facilitate convenience and economize on the travel costs on the 

7

side of players. The major reason for their existence, however, stems from their more lightweight cost structure 

that is characterized with virtually zero marginal cost of adding a new client. This translates into significantly 

lower overhead costs, results in smaller house edge and, therefore, smaller average wagers and larger average 

net gains on the side of the clients [11], [12].  

The advent of the cryptocurrency casinos came as a result of their anonymity feature as well as absence of 

any regulatory oversight. As many other applications of the blockchain technology in its early days, the major 

considerations behind setting up casinos on the blockchain were idealistic, impractical or outright shady in 

nature. The anonymity and laissez-faire regime, however, are not the features that fit best into our line of 

reasoning: indeed, the decentralized infrastructure does not imply any server maintenance costs: the protocol 

is autonomous; the bets are fair: the protocol code is public; its workings are imprinted into the immutable 

ledger forever and can always be verified by anyone.

As a rule, once something new offers better ways for solving old problems, there always is a catch [13]. 

   The Mechanics and Issues of On-Chain Casinos
Summarizing, the blockchain revolution allows for greatly enhanced transparency and efficiency of transactions, 

levels the playing field for online game development and greatly reduces overhead costs erasing the necessity 

of maintaining relationships with trusted third parties, bringing the concept of online casinos to a completely 

new level. 

While being clearly beneficial in some aspects, the net benefits of blockchain to the general public willing to put 

their hard-earned funds on stake are less clear-cut. The reason is that, unfortunately, while being secure and 

trustless, not a single blockchain protocol can compete in terms of efficiency with centralized systems, such as 

those that are used by the off-chain online casinos nowadays. 

This imposes heavy burden on the user experience: one can imagine the winner’s frustration caused by the 

necessity to wait for 10 minutes before knowing if the roulette round actually settled on the blockchain. Even a 

10-second delay can be detrimental to user experience once certain types of online gambling applications are 

concerned3. 

Ordering of transactions is of paramount importance in a distributed ledger (the root of the double-spend 

problem). Unfortunately, simple time stamping cannot be used to achieve distributed consensus on the ordering 

of transactions in a decentralized peer-to-peer network. The blockchain protocols were created instead, offering 

a successful solution to the issue. However, decentralization always comes at a cost. Each block needs time to 

be mined and this creates inherent delays that are detrimental to user experience as far as casino applications 

are concerned4. Therefore, the first problem that needs to be resolved as efficiently as possible before online 

casinos can migrate on-chain is transaction settlement times. 

The second inherent problems lie around transaction fees. Indeed, all the praised benefits of the decentralized 

payment networks, such as instant settlement and virtually absent transaction fees turn their back on those 

daring to employ them for micro-transactions. For example, currently the transaction fee to send ether on the 

3 For example, an online casino (NetEnt) has been heavily criticized by its community for having a delay of less than 300 
milliseconds (0.3 seconds) in knowing whether they won or lost; and delaying the withdrawal of big winnings (e.g. jackpot) has 
been famous in the industry. A simple search in Google “online casino delay” yields nearly 1,000,000 results, indicating how 
prevalent delays in online casinos are and how frustrated the online gambling community is with them. 

4 This, of course, only applies once there is a fundamental limitation on the amount of games that can be played in every 
block. In currently existing applications, there indeed is such limitation – and it’s 1. For as far as the block content is a 
required input for generating randomness, one game outcome is produced for every block.

native Ethereum blockchain is about US$0.351 and sometimes over US$1. Such fees are game stoppers in a 

literal sense when it comes to for example, 5-dollar bets [14], [15]. No one would accept 20% brute transaction 

fees for a US$5 online bet. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the popular blockchains 

currently in existence are based on Proof-of-Work consensus protocols that are infamous for not scaling too 

well. This implies that soon we can and will witness situations where a gambler would have to either pay even 

higher transaction fees or experience large delays in settlement (see problem 1). It is also not clear, how to 

incorporate such choices on the level of the gaming application with more than one party involved. Furthermore, 

given that transaction fees on Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchains are paid in the underlying virtual currency, the 

cost of transaction is actually directly tied to the price of this currency. 

This translates into a proportional increase in transaction costs. Therefore, an ideal solution for an on-chain 

casino would necessitate a protocol that can scale seamlessly and that would have low transaction fees. This is, 

however, far from being the end of the wish list when it comes to blockchain casino applications.

Here we have approached the cornerstone topic in on-chain casino design. The immanent importance of this 

topic can only be matched by the extent of controversy associated with it. Before delving deep into complexities 

of probability theory, let’s summarize what has been said so far

a. The uprising of the casino industry from the early days of humanity until the very end of the XX century 

can be portrayed in standard outlines of economic theory: it has been a long quest towards erasing the 

transaction costs by the means of centralization and institutionalization of the gambling process. 

b. The problems that have remained unresolved included poor transparency, high overheads incurred by 

casinos to maintain lucrative buildings and other required infrastructure that translated into high house 

edges; and, finally, the need to travel to a “physical” location. 

c. An additional problem was that of inclusion: indeed, not everyone could participate in the development 

of new games. Some of these problems have been partially resolved by the slow migration of casinos 

online. Nevertheless, those of poor transparency and large house edges have also remained. In general, 

these are the problems that are inherent to the legacy financial system; the one based on intermediation 

and trust. 

d. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that numerous projects have embraced the challenge to move the 

gambling process on-chain. This, however, turned out to be an ambitious aspiration with numerous 

pitfalls and seemingly unsurpassable technological barriers. While resolving the issue of inclusion, 

transparency (from the gambler’s perspective) and excessive house edges, blockchain gambling 

exacerbated those of high transaction fees and anonymity. It also brought new challenges along with 

it: how do we resolve the issue of slow settlement? 

e. Finally, we addressed the sinle most important problem: the generation of the distributed randomness.

Indeed, how does one generate provably random numbers on-chain? Overall, how one achieves provable 

randomness in applications where multiple parties are involved and the random number generated determines 

the distribution of the monetary gains and losses for those involved? An easy solution would be to use a local 

source of randomness, such as RAND() function in Microsoft Excel©. However, there is a problem with this 

approach that renders it inefficient: local sources of randomness can be easily subverted and thus, there is no 

easy way for all the parties to verify that the number provided by a party is the number actually generated. 

What about public sources of randomness? For example, Random.org, NSA or NIST all serve to provide “pure” 

randomness which is sampled from various natural sources, such as quantum physics processes. While indeed 

being public and random, these sources of random numbers suffer from all those problems we inherit from the 

‘centralized’ yesterday: any application, however distributed, relying on them automatically raises the ‘single

point of failure’ red flag. Their outputs are susceptible to human errors, present an adversary with incentives to 

undermine their workings and finally, give malicious incentives to those running these protocols. 

As always, when one is stuck being unable to find a theoretically convincing and practically appealing answer 

in the domain of centralized applications, the world of distributed consensus is the place to search for answers. 

There is no easy way to get distributed randomness: blockchain protocols are deterministic by nature and, do 

not have implementations of random number generation on the protocol level. But it wouldn’t be blockchain if 

this was the final answer. The following ‘solutions” have been proposed and implemented:

1. Most of the attempts to circumvent this limitation in the end still rely on fresh entropy provided by 

either the users themselves or random oracles that in turn can either be manipulated or have malicious 

incentives of their own. So, random oracles – off-chain – single point of failure – red flag. 

2. Others opted for a different path and proposed using the block hash. While such protocol design is 

much more appealing from a theoretical viewpoint as it generates random numbers on-chain (no red 

flag), it has another major flaw: given sufficiently large monetary incentive miners with sizeable hashing 

power can manipulate the game outcome by not submitting the freshly mined block. Using timestamps 

and virtually any other block content falls victim to the same issue. 

3. Commitment schemes: the most promising solution with two major drawbacks: huge computational 

overhead and possibility that a malicious player will not open the secret after learning the outcome of 

the game. In other words, these schemes lack guaranteed output delivery. Monetary disincentives can 

be introduced to punish malicious actors basically collateralizing the Smart Contract thereby forcing the 

output delivery. In theory it works just fine. In practice one ends up with a slow and terribly expensive 

working protocol with limited applicability. 

As we will show, something that is effective but inefficient can always be improved, but not the other way 

around. Points 1 and 2 unfortunately belong to the latter category, but the situation with the commitment 

schemes is different.

The discussion so far has been quite abstract. A legitimate question is what does it all mean for the distributed 

gambling applications? Let’s review the recent projects in this sphere that have received their part of public 

attention.

Competitors’ Review

A number of other projects utilizing the blockchain are entering the gambling industry by either aiming to 

create a platform for online casinos or by simply placing a specific game or a variety thereof on-chain. As noted 

above, among the issues which are solved by simply creating blockchain-powered versions of the games, three 

main problems remain yet unaddressed:

1. Transaction Settlement Time: it takes significantly longer to settle a transaction on-chain than off of it 

as each block requires time to be mined.

2. Transaction Fees: the fee for each transaction can become prohibitively high and preclude small bet 

sizes.

3. Provably random: the generation of randomness on-chain is a challenging as miners can see and modify 

block headers before everyone else.

DAO.Casino [18] introduces a decentralized system for the online gambling industry which consists of an 

automated value distribution protocol acting as mechanism of incentives based on Ethereum. The team has 

recently began developing Payment Channels to address the first two problems while addressing number three 

by the introduction of the Signidice algorithm (which is suitable only for two parties” games). It goes without 

saying that any casino protocol lacking good quality randomness that can be extended to any number of parties 

cannot serve as a backbone for the decentralized gambling industry. 

BitPoker [19] propose a peer-to-peer protocol where no central actor has influence over the outcome of the 

game. They use Bitcoin and lightning network for transaction settling and blockchain for game state persistence. 

In the white paper of BitPoker (which is a project solely aimed at poker games) none of the aforementioned 

issues is explicitly addressed. 

Edgeless [20] is built on the Ethereum blockchain and claim to be the first to create fully transparent and zero-

house-edge decentralized casino. Edgeless” aspiring team aims to introduce a number of innovations in the 

industry of online casinos; however, their white paper also does not address the three notorious predicaments. 

BitDice [21] is also based on Ethereum but aim to implement IOTA in the future to provide costless transactions. 

For now, the developers of BitDice claim that the move from Ruby to Elixir by Q1 of 2018 would reduce the 

betting latency from 20-40ms to 2-5ms, nevertheless, for now, transaction fees and the generation of 

randomness are not addressed in any meaningful way. 

FunFair [22] is Ethereum based, can launch limitless number of online casinos, it is instant, claim to be ten times 

cheaper in terms of gas cost than other casinos, and propose an innovative way of RNG. FunFair’s ambitious 

project aims to achieve zero latency between the time of user’s interaction with the interface and the result, 

effectively eliminating the first issue. In addition, they pay attention also to both transaction fees and specifically 

target on-chain provably random number generation through the development of Fate Channels. 

Table 1 below summarizes whether each of the projects addresses one or more of the three problems in a 

novel and effective way.

The table above highlights that now as never one needs to appreciate the wisdom embedded in a “devil’s in

industry do not appear to address the most fundamental problems this revolution creates. Any inquiring mind is 

recommended to briefly look at the history of the last century to see what a disaster any unplanned revolution 

is. 

Sp8de is different: details are our passion.

The Mechanics of Sp8de

Sp8de is the new-generation blockchain-based gaming platform aimed at all the participants of contemporary 

casino ecosystem. We call it “new-generation” as Sp8de satisfies all the aforementioned conditions of a ‘proper’ 

blockchain casino. We build Sp8de on top of the blockchain called Cardano [24]. The Cardano project itself 

is a monumental work that embraced the best practices and most far reaching innovations in the area of 

cryptocurrencies and packed them into a single state-of-art system. It is being developed and maintained by a 

large team comprised solely of PhDs in the field of programming and cryptography, and experienced engineers. 

In what follows we will illustrate how Sp8de provides an environment for the design of gambling applications 

which are characterized with:

1. Close-to-absent transaction fees and Proof-of-Stake powered scalability that is beyond the reach of 

any other on-chain casino protocol currently in existence;

2. A mechanism to generate decentralized provenly uniform randomness at arbitrary time-spans;

3. Provides rich Smart Contract functionality that allows for creativity in game design that is bounded 

solely by the fantasy of the developer (and the demand for the resulting product of course);

Fairness of the outcome is essential for gambling; it is the core.  

Sp8de utilizes Cardano to design its ecosystem and thereby solves the problems normally associated with the 

on-chain casinos described above. Here is how:

1. Transaction fees and scalability: the size of transaction fees is normally a function of the degree to 

which a given distributed system scales. Scalability can be defined as the relation between system 

resources and the number of nodes. Scalable systems gain in efficiency as new nodes join the network: 

BitTorrent and IOTA protocols are two prominent examples. Proof-of-Work based blockchain systems 

do not scale by construction: indeed, maintaining a common ledger implies every node possessing a full 

copy of this ledger. Without this condition, the security – most important property of such systems – is 

compromised. Therefore, there is no gain in efficiency when a new node joins the network. Ouroboros is 

a Proof-of-Stake protocol, meaning that at any given time, a trusted set of nodes maintain the integrity 

of the system. This protocol was shown in an experimental setting to be resistant to a handful of attacks 

that are known to plague other systems and are directly relevant to gambling protocols.  

2. Random number generation: finally, Ouroboros, the POS protocol underlying Cardano blockchain in its 

workings fully relies upon generating unbiased (i.e. uniformly distributed) entropy. The beauty of the 

idea is that the blockchain itself serves as a broadcast channel: the uniform randomness is generated 

on-chain! For us, this is the crucial point, so let’s elaborate on it further.

POS systems are heavily dependent on the ability to generate good-quality randomness “to inject 

pure entropy into the system”. Without it, the integrity of the protocol can be interrupted. This stems 

from the fact that if there is a way to manipulate the process of selecting an agent who is chosen to 

validate the next block, an adversary can bias the election process. This is the root of the infamous 

“Nothing-at-Stake” problem and invalidates the whole concept of POS-based distributed consensus 

protocols. Apart from provably random number generation, another pre-condition for the plausibility 

of POS protocols is that these numbers are actually delivered to everyone participating in the protocol. 

In other words, the delivery of uniform randomness has to be guaranteed on the protocol level. Hence, 

12

https://sp8de.com/


to be a valid concept, especially from a formal academic viewpoint, Ouroboros must have a mechanism 

for generating and broadcasting “good” randomness. Furthermore, to be scalable, the generation and 

verification processes must be computationally inexpensive. 

Ouroboros solves these problems by embracing two well-known protocols from the field of distributed 

consensus: coin-tossing application of commitment schemes and verifiable secret sharing. Blending 

these two together produces a miracle: it creates a protocol for creating unbiased public randomness 

in a distributed adversarial setting with guaranteed output delivery. In layman terms, this means that 

Ouroboros:

a. Generates provably random numbers;

b. Guarantees that everyone will get them. Unchanged. 

We will touch upon the topic of randomness again in the technical deep-dive below.

Apart from providing elegant solutions to the existential problems of on-chain casino protocols, Cardano offers 

a rich toolbox for solving several less critical issues:

3. Flexible and finance application-tailored scripting language:  those who have experience with the 

Bitcoin scripting language know how draconian and inflexible it is, those who spent thousands of hours 

grinding through Solidity (the Ethereum scripting language), know how quickly it might become overly 

complex. Rigidity limits the number of applications; complexity limits the set of actors who are capable 

to work with the language and introduces larger scope for unintended errors and unnoticed bugs. To 

create a truly universal platform where those with bright ideas can compete for their share in the overall 

pie, one needs a simpler language whereby, simplicity would not come at the expense of the scope of 

application. Plutus is a general purpose Smart Contract language developed by IOHK and implemented 

in Cardano. 

The core idea is that any type of financial transaction can be decomposed into simpler ones. Therefore, 

all the wide variety of complex financial instruments is comprised of a much smaller set of “foundational 

elements” that create the entire transactional logic. Cardano is designed by matters of code and is 

set to follow best practices; its scripting language is tailored for financial applications: security and 

execution can be “extremely well understood”. 

With a certain degree of abstraction, one can observe strong parallels between any financial derivative 

and most of the gambling applications: in essence these are just contracts between one or more parties 

where outcome is conditioned, in part, on a realization of a random variable. This leads us to conclude 

that Plutus is the best of kind natural fit for writing casino applications. 

Cardano is scalable, secure, and complex yet elegant. The major takeaway is that designing a successful POS 

protocol requires solving the same problems that constrain the creation of provably fair on-chain casinos. With 

Cardano as a backbone, Sp8de is set to become the best of its kind. 

Our claims don’t require you to blindly trust us: all the results we rely on are proven with academic rigor and can 

be accessed by anyone on the ever-growing library of academic papers maintained by the IOHK foundation. 

Our competitors can appeal to the crowd stating that their protocol is unique, efficient and practically difficult 

to manipulate. Believing this implies having faith in their team: all the existing projects are either work-in-

progress or completed, but centralized. All the results we rely upon are established with mathematical rigor 

and academic formalism by those for whom developing cryptography as a science is a profession, and state of 

the art code is an everyday tool.

   The Sp8de Protocol

Before delving deeper into the mechanics of the SP8DE protocol itself, we opt to give a brief overview of 

the Cardano blockchain and, in particular, the Ouroboros protocol that underpins it. As mentioned above, 

Ouroboros is the first provably secure POS protocol. All POS protocols rely heavily on the miner selection 

process whereby a participant is selected at random to sign a block of transactions. In essence it is a POW 

system without the anchor to the real world – that of processing power. A precondition for an effective 

POS protocol is the ability to select the next ‘miner’ (or minter using the POS jargon) randomly with the 

uniform probability which is proportional to one’s stake in the system. The uniform nature of the probability 

distribution is an essential element: if it can be skewed or biased by any protocol participant, the security is 

compromised rendering the protocol useless. 

At the heart of Ouroboros is the so-called Follow-The-Satoshi (FTS) procedure. Its essence is simple: 

assuming input of the uniform randomness, FTS is guaranteed to select a stakeholder with the uniform 

probability proportional to the number N of coins (or satoshis) one possess relative to the total number of 

coins in the system. In short, FTS does the job: it possess the qualities required to make an effective POS 

protocol. But, as always, there is a catch: FTS assumes input of ‘proper’ randomness. But where does it come 

from? Before answering this question, let us lead your through the mechanics of FTS procedure itself: it will 

prove useful later on. 

The FTS proceeds along the following steps:

a. The fresh randomness is injected into the system;

b. It is used to ‘pick’ a single satoshi, the smallest unit of account in the system, an analogy to cent for US 

dollars;

c. All satoshis have ids. The state of the protocol determines which user (determined by the wallet id) 

was the last one to hold the satoshi selected;

d. This user becomes the ‘leader’ or in other words is entitled to sign a block;

This simple procedure satisfied the required qualities of the protocol: assuming the input of unbiased 

randomness, it will select a stakeholder with the probability proportional to one’s stake in the system. 

Injecting ‘good’ randomness into the protocol is another important concern. FTS assumes input of good 

randomness, but in order for the protocol to work this randomness needs to be generated on-chain. At this 

point it is important to highlight the similarity of the design challenge that faces the POS protocols and on-

chain gambling applications: both of them require on-going inputs of unbiased distributed randomness. 

 

Ouroboros employs the Fair Coin Tossing (FCT) procedure to generate randomness. This procedure is a 

known result in the field of academic and applied cryptography. It was first coined over 30 years ago and 

its mechanism is well studied and understood and is, thus, very efficient. The idea is that multiple entities 

participating in the protocol exchange ‘messages’ (the so-called commitments) that are encrypted by the 

sender and therefore are not known up-front by the receiver. When opened (by exchanging the keys) and 

combined, these messages produce an output that cannot be known a priori and neither can be manipulated 

by those participating.  One problem that remains is the possibility of one of the parties aborting the protocol 

by not sending the key to one’s message. In the Ouroboros protocol this issue is solved by employing yet 

another protocol that is called Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) PVSS basically ensures that (given 

the honest majority) the message is delivered to everyone participating even if a malicious party chooses not

https://sp8de.com/

   Contents S P 8 D E

to share one’s key. The combined procedure is called the Fair Coin Tossing protocol with Guaranteed Output 

Delivery (FCT GOD). 

 

Armed with the PVSS and FCT machinery, Ouroboros protocol proceeds in steps: the minor steps are called 

slots and represent a spot in the protocol time whereby an elected leader has a chance of signing a block of 

transactions receiving the fee reward. The major steps are called epochs: these contain multiple slots and end 

with running of the FTS procedure. A stylized illustration of a single epoch is given in figure X:

The protocol is broken down into slots, slots contain blocks, and blocks contain transactions. The outcome of 

the FTS procedure determines all the slot leaders (those entitled to sign a block) for the following epoch. A 

stylized version of the multi-epoch protocol is illustrated below:

 

Ui – user id

Si – amount of funds (cum number of 
satoshis)

R` – random String for Epoch (prime is 
user to determine the epoch)

En – user selected to sign the block in a 
given slot

GOD – Guaranteed Output Delievery

   Contents S P 8 D E

At the beginning of every epoch the new distribution of stakes is determined from the blockchain state (the 

previous distribution along with all the signed transactions of the past epoch). Given that the distribution 

of tokens among stakeholders is taken from the past transaction history once it is set in stone at the end of 

every epoch, it is impossible to know upfront which satoshi will be chosen. The FCT GOD procedure is run in 

parallel with the protocol and is used to generate randomness for the next FST.  

Being designed along these lines, Ouroboros is a blockchain protocol that makes the blockchain itself serve as 

a broadcast channel for randomness. By solving the problem of the POS protocols, Ouroboros simultaneously 

offers a unique toolbox for developing and running decentralized casino applications in an efficient and 

provably secure manner. The key words that are scattered over countless pages of academic papers written 

by the IOHK foundation are: ‘guaranteed’, ‘provably’ and ‘secure’. What else can one wish for when it comes to 

online gaming?  

At the heart of Sp8de is the protocol that generates unbiased randomness at arbitrary frequencies: it 

synthesizes the workings of Ouroboros and Sp8de blockchain itself to generate entropy. 

All the gambling applications on the Sp8de blockchain represent complex Smart Contracts that use SPX as their 

native currency. The outcomes of all the games on the Sp8de blockchain are conditioned upon the realizations 

of the coin tossing procedure that drives the Ouroboros protocol. The entire Sp8de ecosystem will flourish 

around these injections of entropy. The use of the seed will be application-specific. The mechanism will work 

as follows:

1. Cardano epoch begins with a fresh seed that derives from the distribution of coins among holders at 

the end of the previous epoch. This information rests on the public Cardano blockchain and is, thus 

verifiable by any interested party.

2. For every slot of the current epoch a coin tossing protocol with guaranteed output delivery is run 

facilitating the election of a slot leader. This protocol has the name: “Follow-the-Satoshi” or FTS for 

short. The essence of FTS is that, given a distribution of all the coins among all the coin holders, that is 

fixed at the beginning of an epoch and an injection of fresh randomness by the means of coin tossing 

routine, the protocol selects one leader for every slot of the current epoch. The random string that is 

used in the selection process is provided independently by the participants of the network through 

running the coin tossing protocol. 

3. At this point an issue becomes apparent: fresh randomness is injected into the protocol only once 

for every epoch. It means that limiting ourselves to using only this randomness for determining the 

outcomes of Sp8de-based casino applications constrains us to running only one provably fair round 

every epoch. This is highly infrequent. This issue, if left unresolved, renders the whole concept of Sp8de 

obsolete. We can’t afford it. 

Therefore, here is our plan:

a. Create a Smart Contract that constantly runs the Cardano native coin tossing protocol with 

guaranteed output delivery. Every time a particular block is “minted” on the native Cardano 

blockchain, the Smart Contract emits a random string that inherits all the “good” qualities of the 

Cardano’s native coin tossing protocol. The nodes participating in the protocol (those who actually 

commit and then open) represent all the online nodes having stake in the Sp8de blockchain. 

This ensures that computational overhead of running (already very efficient) SCRAPE protocol is 

significantly reduced: the number of shares that have to be verified is limited to Sp8de nodes only. 

In this way, we detach the leader selection process from the process of generating random numbers 

that we actually need: the coin distribution evolves on Cardano, while entropy is being created on 

Sp8de.

b. By implementing this modification, we, however, expose Sp8de to other risks: on very short time 

intervals while new blocks on Cardano blockchain are not ‘stable” an adversary can fork the chain if 

one is selected as a slot leader. While in the presence of honest majority, such actions can benefit 

an adversary only with a negligible probability on the native Cardano blockchain, the Sp8de chain is 

much more susceptible to these attacks as it relies on relatively smaller amounts of aggregated on-

chain entropy (one block against one epoch). We resolve this issue by employing Verifiable Random 

Function (VRF) developed by IOHK team in their work on Ouroboros Praos. In a nutshell, given 

sufficient input entropy, VRF outputs an unpredictable value.  

c. Now, even if we assume that a determined and highly sophisticated adversary by being present on 

both chains (Cardano and Sp8de) and being elected as a slot leader on the Cardano chain, wishes to 

make a malicious fork that would affect the results of the coin tossing procedure, the application of 

VRF, makes the results of any such manipulation unpredictable, thus useless. 

d. Once the settlement issue is resolved, there remains nothing else that can be subverted by an 

adversary on Sp8de chain without the need to manipulate the overarching Ouroboros protocol that 

drives the Cardano blockchain. Indeed, the settlement of Sp8de transaction is done on Cardano, 

the randomness is provided by the changing Cardano stake distribution and local SCRAPE protocol 

that is run by Sp8de nodes. Any potential incentive to manipulate both chains is mitigated by the 

use of VRF.

With the Sp8de protocol set up and running, we can start actually deploying the applications that represent 

some gaming logic implemented using Cardano’s smart contract scripting language. These applications run on 

Sp8de blockchain and get settled with every new heartbeat of the protocol or less frequently depending on 

the actual application. 

The efficiency constraints are, of course, inevitable when it comes to application that would require extremely 

high-frequency outputs (such as once every 5 seconds). We cannot claim that all the issues with such applications 

will be resolved before the protocol is deployed. We can state, however, that Sp8de is in the best position to 

solve them. 

Token Distribution

The entire token distribution will be 8,888,888,888 of which 3,655,555,558.4 (41.125%) will be in the form of 

token sale and 3,455,555,552 (38.875%) will be given as a jackpot to those who have participated in the “token 

sale” rounds. The remainder of the tokens 1,777,777,778 (20%) will be vested with the team for the purposes 

of marketing, advisory, and further development of the project (see the Token Proceeds Utilization section for 

further details on the use of the proceeds from the token distribution). There is a one year vesting period that 

applies to these tokens. From Table 2 it becomes clear that the SPX tokens received per ETH are decreasing 

after each sale while the tokens distributed are increasing following the Pre-Sale stage.

Figure 4 Jackpots: Number of lots and per lot reward

So, those participating in the earlier jackpot rounds have small chance of winning large lot, while those participating later on have larger chance of winning, but are rewarded with 
smaller lots. In addition, earlier contributors participate in more jackpot rounds: e.g. sale I investors try their luck four times, while those entering at sale III can only participate in two 
jackpots. This shouldn’t discourage late participation: the largest combined pool of prize tokens is played during the fourth jackpot round. For every lot we run a procedure which 
randomly selects one token out of those already issued. The holder of this token becomes the winner of the lot. 

Each token being sold has a specific factor attached to it, the jackpot factor. The likelihood to win a lot is proportional to this factor. Mind, that jackpot factors are ordered: even within 
one sale round, earlier contribution is rewarded with more ‘powerful’ tokens. The distribution of these factors for every round is shown in the table below.

Participants in the earlier jackpot rounds have small chance of winning 
large lot, while those participating later have higher c hance of winning, 
but are rewarded with smaller lots.

   how do the Jackpots work?
1. In essence, every Jackpot is an airdrop of tokens, however, with major modifications.

2. Every token sold during the preceding Sale rounds has a chance of winning a Jackpot during the 

subsequent Jackpot phases. For example, if you participated in the Pre-Sale then you have a chance to 

participate in all four Jackpot phases, but if you participated in Sale IV then you get to participate only 

in Jackpot IV.

3. Jackpots are large lots of SPX tokens that will be granted to a “lucky guy” – the owner of the token that 

will be chosen as a winner. So, any winner will get the entire lot. For example, there will be only 10 wallets 

(or less) who will win 28,888,888 SPX tokens during Jackpot I. 

4. Jackpot tokens do not participate in the subsequent jackpots, so winning a jackpot does not increase 

one’s chances of winning another one. 

5. An important aspect of the jackpot campaign is the presence of Jackpot Factors attached to every 

token. This makes the game much more interesting and allows anyone to actually influence one’s odds 

to win the Jackpot.

The factor is the probability multiplier. Without these factors, every token would have a probability n-1 * a of 

winning one jackpot in a particular Jackpot phase; where n is the total number of tokens and a is a constant 

equal to the number of jackpots within every particular Jackpot phase. With factors, the formula changes to

where j is the factor of a token, i is the group of tokens, n - the number of tokens in the group. 

Every group is defined as having some factor that every token within this group holds and a number of tokens 

that belong to this group. For example, if you participated in the Pre-Sale by getting 1,000,000 SPX and you 

got a multiplier of 88.8 (the maximum), then every single token that you hold has a 4.93 times higher chance of 

winning one or multiple of the jackpots during Jackpot phases I until IV, as compared to someone holding the 

same amount of tokens but with a factor 18. 

The total probability of you winning the jackpot during Jackpot phases I until IV is calculated as follows:

where j is a group id of tokens that you hold, n – the number within each group – therefore, a 

simple weighted probability. Of course, these numbers are different for every sale and jackpot 

round depending on how many tokens remain in the pools. Following the logic of from the previous 

example, the chance of winning a jackpot in Jackpot I with these parameters is equal to ~2.22%1. 

1 (1,000,000*88.8)/(18* 92,941,911+…+88.8* 84,942,511+17* 40,662,086+…+58.8* 37,162,348)*10 = 0.022167377

   how jackpots work in practice?
1. Current jackpot phase (e.g. Sale I) ends at 9:00 AM (2018-02-14) UTC.

2. An additional half of an hour (until 9:30 AM) is given for all the ‘late’ transactions to settle. At 12:30 new 

SPX tokens are generated and distributed among the investors.Jackpots are large lots of SPX tokens 

that will be granted to a “lucky guy” – the owner of the token that will be chosen as a winner. So, any 

winner will get the entire lot. For example, there will be only 10 wallets (or less) who will win 28,888,888 

SPX tokens during Jackpot I. 

3. A list of transactions along with the factors and wallets of participating users is generated. The ‘win’ 

intervals are constructed taking into account the stake in the system and the factors. Additionally, we 

include the following variables: ETH addresses of participants, Start, End – the tokens participating in 

the jackpot. 

25

   Contents S P 8 D E

I.      We calculate the Start, End for every user transaction. For example:

II.      Now, we relate the intervals in (I) to the user id’s, effectively creating a list of the 

where H is the hash, n – the number of the last block.

1. Thereafter this list along with other relevant information is made public.

2. During the day of the jackpot (in this example, 2018-02-15), at 9:00 AM UTC the seed for 

generating random numbers is generated in the following way:

a. We take the hash of the first slot with a block (not empty slot) confirmed after 9:00 AM 

UTC;

b. We wait for the first block issued on the Bitcoin blockchain after the ADA block in ‘a’ to be 

confirmed and take its hash;

c. We determine the number of the ETH block confirmed after the BTC block in ‘b’ and take the 

hash of the ETH block confirmed two blocks earlier;

d. We concatenate the three hashes into one string:

e. We calculate the SHA-256 using the string in ‘e’ as the seed;

f. We take the resulting 32-byte hash and turn it into an array of 8 integers which we will later 

use as the actual seed for generating random numbers

https://sp8de.com/
https://sp8de.com/


g. We put this seed into MT19937Generator and generate N random numbers in the range 1: MAX 

RANGE, where N is the number of jackpots, MAX RANGE is the weighted sum of the coins 

participating and their respective factors – basically the End parameter for the last participating id.

h. The prize distribution is made public, SPX are sent to the happy winners.

   Unpurchased Tokens Allocation

There is a possibility that some part of every token Sale will remain unpurchased. As illustrated in the table 

below the majority of the tokens that remain unsold will be automatically distributed among the Jackpots, 

increasing the number of tokens to be received by the participants in every Sale. If any tokens are allocated to 

the Sp8de Foundation they will be used for further development and promotion of the project.

DISTRIBUTIOn OF UnPURChASED TOkEnS

Phase Foundation Jackpot I Jackpot II Jackpot III Jackpot IV

Pre-Sale 30% 30% 20% 20%  

Sale I 20% 15% 40% 25%  

Sale II* 0%

Sale III* 20%

Sale IV* 30%  

Table 6 Unpurchased tokens’ distribution to the Jackpots

For example, if 10,000,000 SPX has not been purchased during the Pre-Sale phase then 3,000,000 SPX will 

be allocated to the Sp8de Foundation, another 3,000,000 SPX will be attributed towards Jackpot phase I; 

2,000,000 SPX for Jackpot phase II; and the last 2,000,000 SPX for Jackpot phase III. These attributions 

will be made in equal amounts towards every of the jackpots within each of the Jackpot phases – i.e. during 

Jackpot I all of the jackpots will be increased by 300,000 SPX resulting in 29,188,888.80 SPX per jackpot. 

The same logic applies to the rest of the Jackpots and all unsold tokens.1

The soft cap of the project is 4,500 ETH and hard cap is 31,000 ETH. 

* To reward everyone in a reasonable manner we will distribute unsold tokens as follows: 100% of all unsold tokens 
during  Sale II, 80% of all unsold tokens during Sale III, and 70% of all unsold tokens during sale IV to all participants in 
the Sp8de Pre-Sale and ICO.  This will be done in proportion to the amount of their investment as percent of the total 
invesment amount fromall participants. All the tokens will be distributed after the ICO (March 11, 2018).

Token Proceeds Utilization

The proceeds of the token sales as well as the tokens that remain in possession of the team will be used to 

promote and develop the project as outlined in the Road Map section of this paper. In the figure below, we 

show how the proceeds will be utilized. As we have shown earlier Sp8de is development intense, therefore we 

allocate the majority of the proceeds to development and operations as we believe that proper management 

and highly skilled developers are in the core of the success of this project. Furthermore, when needed the 

tokens allocated to the Sp8de Foundation and the team might be used for further promotion and as part of an 

incentives scheme.

Conclusion of the ICO

The Sp8de ICO will be concluded on March 11, 2018 and Sp8de tokens will be moved to the respective wallets 

by March 16, 2018. We intend to hold the funds in multiple currencies to protect the project’s funds against 

adverse idiosyncratic price movements (see the section on the ICO proceeds management).

Listing on Exchanges

Until the end of March, 2018 collaboration with cryptocurrency exchanges will be initiated in order to list the 

Sp8de token on as many large exchanges as possible. We will try to avoid SPX being listed on small exchanges 

or exchanges with notorious reputation. An official announcement will be made on the Sp8de website with 

regard to the exchange on which the token is to be listed five business days prior to the listing event itself. 

Listing on exchanges will not end at this stage as it is a continuous process.

   April 1, 2018 – July 31, 2018

Minimum Viable Product

During the Q2, 2018 major developments of the Cardano blockchain and fundamental expansions of the 

project’s ecosystem are expected. In particular, the end of that quarter will see the release of most of the 

Shelley phase planned functionality enhancements and other related protocol improvements. For us, however, 

this will be only a small step towards realizing the ultimate potential of the Khronos protocol. The problem is 

that the delivery of promised Khronos functionality is contingent upon the completion of the Goguen phase of 

Cardano roadmap: IELE, Plutus and associated compilers are essential for building Khronos.

Therefore, instead of sitting and waiting for the required releases we will develop all the core functionality on 

Solidity using ETC blockchain as the base. There are multiple good reasons behind preferring ETC blockchain 

over any other solution existing on the market. The three major reasons are that:

1. Cardano and ETC have (at least partially) same user base, founders and community in general;

2. One of the priorities on Cardano’s Goguen phase roadmap is to develop translators/compilers from 

Solidity and Plutus Core for IELE, the new-generation virtual machine that underpins the smart contract 

functionality. Solidity seems like an obvious candidate given this native support.

3. ETC is on average much less congested and thus significantly faster than the ETH network. The sidechain 

functionality that is being developed in Callisto initiative will also prove important for scalability that is 

essential for the SP8DE platform.

Using Solidity SP8DE team will develop the product with the minimum required functionality: a Fair Coin 

Tossing protocol with Guaranteed Output Delivery (FCT GOD) that is capable to output random numbers at 

high (not arbitrary) frequencies. Other significant functionality enhancements will be postponed until the next 

Roadmap Stage.

Summarizing, by the end of the MVP (II) stage of our roadmap, SP8DE will have a version of the SP8DE protocol 

implemented on Solidity with a narrower functionality and limited scalability. Yet, this version of the protocol 

will be ready to be compiled on IELE due to certain degree of compatibility between the systems.

https://sp8de.com/
https://sp8de.com/


34

   Contents S P 8 D E

Furthermore, this stage of our roadmap will see SP8DE exploring the design of the general decentralized 

house casino DApps. In particular, we will model the economic incentives of the decentralized house design. 

The decentralized house is among the most challenging and exciting theoretical and practical issues to be 

resolved by the SP8DE team. We will be having an entire blog thread dedicated solely to the game-theory and 

implementation challenges we will encounter. In fact, the decentralized house design implies having a novel 

market currently non-existent in the real world: the market for the gambling risk. The house edge serves as the 

‘price’ of the risk of allowing passive execution of the bets. So, it’s the price of betting against the average skill 

of gamers. As this line of reasoning illustrates, the potential for economic analysis of the incentive structure 

design of decentralized house applications is immense. During this stage of the roadmap we will be concerned 

exactly with this. The community involvement is of high importance for us: we are excited to hear feedback/

consider proposals, etc.

We will expand our team to include one or several professionals with economic/mathematical background(s) 

prior to getting started.

Swap of the ERC20 Token to the Native SP8DE Token

We hope that by the end of July, 2018 Cardano will be sufficiently developed to incorporate the UIA functionality. 

Once this is done, we will issue our SPX tokens on Cardano and implement a 1:1 swap. From this moment 

onwards, the entire SP8DE infrastructure will be based on the Cardano blockchain.

Parallel Development on Cardano

All along the way, we will have an entire task force dedicated solely to exploring the progress of the Cardano 

project. We will develop SP8DE in parallel with Cardano utilizing all the pieces of functionality available.

Debit Cards

In Q2, 2018 Cardano is planning on introducing the debit cards that would make ADA, the native Cardano coin, 

spendable seamlessly anywhere. We will work on getting all the regulatory approvals and other compliance 

matters right to do the same for the SPX token. Allowing for the instant payments with SPX would make it truly 

a universal betting chip. We, however, expect severe regulatory issues as the payment processing industry is 

quite hostile in terms of compliance. Yet, we will do our best to make the SPX debit card dream come true as 

soon as possible.

   August 1, 2018 – December 31, 2018

Deploying SP8DE on Cardano

This period will be marked with major developments on Cardano, basically making it a fully functional blockchain 

with smart contracts live and ready for deployment. The major milestones of the Goguen phase (the third phase 

of Cardano development timeline) are the development of Plutus Core, CCL (Cardano Computational Layer) 

and IELE, the Cardano virtual machine. Basically, at this point, the functionality for implementing SP8DE on 

Cardano will be ready on the Cardano side.

At this moment, we will migrate our code from Solidity to Plutus and deploy the MVP developed earlier on 

Cardano. This will mark the beginning of the development of the most complex and intricate parts of the SP8DE 

protocol, those that have to do with increasing the efficiency (i.e. increasing the output frequencies) beyond 

that of the underlying blockchain itself. Our aim is to be able to output thousands of random strings per second 

if needed. This is similar in essence to the problem faced by the decentralized exchanges: the decentralized 

order book can only be as efficient as the underlying blockchain itself. We will go beyond that.

Using ETC blockchain and Solidity – build the decentralized house MVP

At this point, we will have the theoretical foundation for the economics for the decentralized house applications 

ready to turn into a working Solidity code. We assume that we will stick to Solidity to deploy the MVP. This, 

however, does not need to hold true and might change subject to the degree to which Cardano will be ready to 

accommodate the desired extent of smart contract flexibility.

So, basically, the aim of this would be to design an application (say, Black Jack) whereby anyone participating 

could become a part of the house. By diversifying (i.e. pooling the funds) the risk of every backer and allowing the 

house edge to be determined purely by the market, our goal is to find the equilibrium level of the house edge. 

If such design is actually possible, we hope to arrive at a product superior to any currently existing centralized 

solutions: the world of gambling without economic frictions.

   December 31, 2018 – and beyond
Going forward, our major goals will be to perfect the protocol and put all the connections that 
we will have established to their best use: the widespread adoption of the SP8DE protocol 
throughout the entire gaming (and other) industry. This adoption will inevitably lead SP8DE to 
become the quality standard, hopefully making any application that does not use it suspicious 
at best.

   Financial projections

The SP8DE venture itself is a BVI (British Virgin Islands)-incorporated entity with the classic 
set of features from the corporate world: while being crypto-powered and driven and we 
still have a balance sheet, income statement, strategic goals, banking relationships, and etc. 
But don’t judge us too quickly for being not 100% sincere: our priority is witnessing how the 
Sp8de protocol thrives and receives mass adoption and today we still haven’t figured out a 
way DAO can e.g. get a license.

A classic nature of business organization implies having to answer the classic set of questions 
that every start-up (that we essentially are) has to address, one of them being “what’s your 
business model?” Narrowing down this question we end up having to lay down the revenue 
model and the cost structure of our venture. Intelligent management of these variables defines 
the venture success in the long-run.

Revenue Sources

1. The ICO campaign: essentially a token sale event is a way of crowd funding whereby the product being 

distributed represents a claim on future use of software: a token is the right to use the blockchain, 

making use of the blockchain holds only as much utility as the functions that it provides, the problems 

that it solves – just like utility of using regular software. This is why from the accounting standpoint; 

money raised during the ICO can be classified as revenue (with some liability component to it). After 

subtracting all relevant expenses, the remainder is retained inside and used to develop the venture.

2. The transaction fees: we envision the SP8DE protocol as being a platform hosting a myriad of DApps 

(Decentralized Applications) of various nature and feeding entropy inside them via an API-like interface. 

In our design every transaction within the DApp (e.g. betting on zero in roulette) is a part of the 

transactional logic of the smart contract powering the DApp, so there will be no fees that need to be 

paid. The fees are only paid for transferring funds from a DApp to another DApp or in other words, every 

time when the actual settlement takes place on the blockchain itself. Every such fee will be distributed 

as follows:

In other words, every transaction fee is divided between the miner’s fee and premium, the fee for the 

developer who built the DApp and a small part that goes to the foundation for sustaining the SP8DE 

project. This latter part will be our major revenue driver in the long run and obviously scales proportionately 

with the popularity of the platform.

3. The marketing revenue: while being open-source, SP8DE will have all the attributes of a classic software 

developing startup: of course, we will have a website, blog, wiki, etc. We will monetize the traffic on these 

resources by advertising. Yet, we will abstain at all times from interrupting in any way the popularity 

equilibrium within our ecosystem: no DApps will get priority over others – only the crowd decides who 

thrives and prospers and who is left in the backwaters of history.

https://sp8de.com/
https://sp8de.com/


37

   Contents S P 8 D E

4. The SPX tokens: a large number of SPX tokens remain at our disposal. We will dispose of these whenever 

we see fit (after the 1-year founders’ vesting period) thereby generating additional revenue streams.

5. Commissions for betting: we will disclose the nature of this revenue stream in a separate white paper 

to be released soon.

   Cost Structure

The development of Sp8de is not a standalone task that simply implies having a team of 
developers and a lead that would produce the protocol that will then magically create the 
revenue streams. On the contrary, while the expenses towards development are substantial, 
they will not materialize in value producing assets unless supported by a) proper advisory board 
that would serve to alleviate the penetration into the gambling market; b) marketing as well 
as listing on exchanges which will help the wide adoption of the protocol by popularizing and 
making available the SPX token; c) licensing and legal advice; and d) operations’ department 
that would serve as a guiding force behind the allocation and structure of all expenses by 
making sure that even a penny is not spent unwisely

A classic nature of business organization implies having to answer the classic set of questions 
that every start-up (that we essentially are) has to address, one of them being “what’s your 
business model?” Narrowing down this question we end up having to lay down the revenue 
model and the cost structure of our venture. Intelligent management of these variables defines 
the venture success in the long-run.

Cost Structure

1. The development team: here, the costs in the beginning of the project are negligible to none, nevertheless 

as the revenue streams of the Sp8de project are driven, first and foremost, by the development of the 

platform for eSports betting and the Sp8de protocol, these costs will begin rising sharply once these 

activities begin. The objective is to begin with a small development team which will have an encompassing 

knowledge of all Sp8de products, which later will grow much larger and more segmented, specializing 

on the development of each of the Sp8de revenue drivers.

2. The advisory board: the spending on advisory are large in the beginning, this is due to the fact that 

the Sp8de project has to be placed properly within the market niches where the expenses for the 

development of the project will be most efficiently utilized to serve and/or create the customer needs.

3. Marketing team: the marketing team will work closely with the advisors in order to reach the markets 

for which the Sp8de development team is creating products, but also will work towards creation of new 

markets which is a relatively marketing-heavy task

4. Legal counsel: both the crypto space and its integration within the current online betting environment 

are both relatively young and weakly regulated. Nevertheless, as these industries mature and more 

sub-industries are created from their interconnections also the regulatory burden on all businesses in 

this sector will exacerbate.

5. Operations department: this department will take care of the day-to-day operations of the company 

but also the medium to long-term cost planning and revenue projections. As the company grows this 

department will become larger and more complex in terms of employees and their location and their 

management.

In what follows we will visualize and describe briefly the incurred and projected revenues and 
expenses for the period December 31, 2017 – January 31, 2019.

Breakdown of Expenses by Type and Percent of Total

Figure 4 Expenses by type as percent of total

While marketing expenses are relatively large until May they will gradually decrease and the operating and 

development expenditures will continue to grow as Sp8de focuses on the development of the core product and 

the management of the company as a whole.

Legal expenses rise and then gradually fall as the main licenses are obtained, nevertheless these expenses may 

grow during 2019 along with those allocated for advisory. On the other hand, the allocation of funds towards 

marketing is expected to fall in time as stronger ties to the industry are established.

Number of Employees by Function 

The headcount will grow rapidly as the project enters the development phase in March, 2018 when the 

Operations department will add four new members – specialists for marketing, accounting, administration, and 

a one support. In addition, the development team will also grow in both headcount but also expenses as larger 

part of the budged is allocated for salaries for the developers as reflected in the previous figure.

In the figures to the right, we show the net 

income of Sp8de when considering that 70%, 

50%, and 20% of the ICO is complete. In these 

graphs we exclude the proceeds from the 

ICO as these “revenues” are one-time and do 

not represent the income generated by the 

operations of the company. The first revenue 

driver is that of the developed platform for 

eSports betting which is expected to become 

functional starting June, 2018. The reason for 

the slow growth of the revenues is that the 

market reach will be relatively weaker caused 

by weaker proportionately lower marketing 

and advisory expenses thought the period 

which. Break-even is expected to be reached 

by January, 2019 given that 50% of the funds 

are collected.

Appendix

The (partial) solution to the distributed randomness that is commonly used today was inspired by a problem 

posed and resolved by Blum in 1981: how can one ensure common uniformly distributed randomness in 

multiparty applications? [23] In other words: how can, say, two people being geographically distant and using 

only a phone, toss a coin and be sure that the outcome is fair? The answer on this question is quite technical 

(albeit intuitive) and is beyond the scope of this paper. The solution originally proposed by Bloom while being 

elegant, relies on the honest majority assumption. It is therefore susceptible to the 51% attack whereby an 

adversary can bias the output5 or even prevent the honest parties from receiving any output at all. 

By relying on Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) assuming an honest majority, random beacon is capable of 

providing a reliable source of good randomness and yet suffers from two main issues: firstly, the necessity of 

dealer-party interaction impedes scalability and secondly, only the actively participating parties can verify that 

the protocol was actually performed fairly (in the context of today’s real-world, say blockchain, applications, 

this implies that off-line nodes, once online, cannot update their version of the chain in a trivial manner). The 

former issue can be resolved by applying non-interactive VSS, the latter, by using PVSS or Publicly Verifiable 

Secrete Sharing protocols. In the end, one needs to balance the scalability and security. While for the majority of 

applications the latter is preferred, for gambling applications where both, security and speed are important, it is 

less clear cut. The major issue with the PVSS lies in the way it handles the computational overhead: the number 

of computations required to verify n shares grows exponentially in n. 

All about the scientific work carried out at Input-Output Hong Kong can be found in the URLs provided in [24].

5 We deem, however, the possibility of the 51% attack negligible as is common in the blockchain applications.
