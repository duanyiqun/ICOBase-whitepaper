The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM is a single globally-sourced healthcare 
service platform for the public that begins with free Human Doctor-AI 
assisted Video Telemedicine service (DOCADEMIC APP) already in use in 
20 countries by thousands of users and an associated suite of AI assisted 
tools and social network for the medical community (Docademic for 
Doctors). Combined, these produce the highest level of free basic quality 
healthcare allowing any individual to access the benefits and knowledge of 
healthcare that technology now permits. 

The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC APP is built on top of 
DOCADEMIC´s existing, patient data routing and AI assisted technologies 
soon to be blockchain enabled. With its simplicity of use It becomes the 
ultimate resource for anyone who needs orientation in a health-related issue
—a one touch system that connects any patient with a Doctor through Video 
Telemedicine for free, from any country a user is located in. All patient 
information will be secured on a blockchain and represents a perfect 
On-Ramp to healthcare services on a blockchain. In comparison, other 
healthcare related blockchain projects don’t have an effective On-Ramp to 
healthcare services. With our free Telemedicine service we can get the 
masses to benefit from blockchain technology in Healthcare.

The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social 
network offers Ongoing Medical education, Patient referrals, Tools for 
doctors everyday practice, and Real Time Reporting of epidemiological data 
for our clients and researchers. 

Serving all client sizes and requirements: The DOCADEMIC Platform 
combines it’s DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social 
network to derive high-end services such as real-time geographic 
epidemiological data reporting, Automated AI-Driven treatment and 
diagnosis suggestions for Doctors in institutions or private practice, massive 
access to patient populations for preventative campaigns, and 
DOCADEMIC´s advanced proprietary Tools such as its AI-assisted 
Electronic Health Record and Digital Vademecum. 

A universal native Token: the MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY, MTC is the 
fuel that will power all services DOCADEMIC provides. We are already in 

M T C
�



�6
talks with Healthcare institutions, Governments and partners to make MTC 
the preferred Token for their own upcoming and existing medical services, 
as they migrate to decentralized platforms. We envision MTC will be used in 
the broader Healthcare industry and any other industries for various 
purposes including payment and remittance. 

The end goal: DOCADEMIC is building a solid, global Healthcare utility—an 
advanced platform the entire patient population and medical community will 
use to great advantage; where anyone can participate as users and Token 
holders. 

DOCADEMIC will become a complete healthcare ecosystem for the 
worldwide patient/Doctor population with digital access.

Background

M T C
�



�8
When Satoshi Nakamoto brought Blockchain into the world in 2009, few 
visionaries understood the disruptive shock wave that would start to 
reshape the Healthcare industry. Like the Internet and Gutenberg press, it 
promises to distribute power and control of information among individuals 
and remove it from the clutches of the elite. 
Since, Bitcoin went from a market cap of zero to $70 billion powered by 
blockchain technology. This is just the beginning. The market cap of all 
Crypto Tokens combined stands at over $140 billion—with the surrounding 
infrastructure and ecosystem likely worth a lot more. 

Most Crypto Token value so far has come from speculation and trading. 
Many are looking to find the “next Bitcoin”.  Almost every day new Crypto 
Tokens comes to market to seek fortune on hundreds of exchanges 
worldwide, and thousands more will follow. Utility of these tokens is key to 
their success.

New and old industries powered by millions of individuals and new 
businesses will build their entire foundations on these decentralized Crypto 
Token based ecosystems. From ordinary payments to important health data 
sharing, huge institutional transfers, fundraising and investments, smart 
contracts and new services that are just being imagined into existence—
disruption is coming at a rapid rate. Healthcare is a fundamental part of this 
transition and possibly the industry that will be benefited the most.

The new way of accessing healthcare is here. Democratization of 
health has begun. The power and utility are now in everyone’s hands. 

Here’s a few interesting statistics. The global healthcare 
expenditure market processes $1–2 trillion in transactions 
per day. Cryptocurrency’s daily share in all its industries 
including healthcare is relatively smaller at around $2 billion
—although it sometimes reaches $4–6 billion. While there 
are 58 countries in the world with universal healthcare, there 
are over 100 Countries with no universal or free healthcare. 
Healthcare services that use crypto-tokens and blockchain 
are just being born. When we look at these figures, they 

M T C
�



�9
indicate that the crypto healthcare-market is going to 
continue an upward trend as more healthcare services start 
using blockchain technology. We as human beings all need 
this revolutionary innovation. 

Enter DOCADEMIC. A successful healthcare technology company with an 
impeccable reputation and healthcare industry pedigree. As of September 
2016, we are the first global healthcare technology company in the world to 
have launched a free video telemedicine service currently active with 
verified users in 20 countries. Yes, Docademic has Doctors on call 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week serving the public in these countries. Our 
DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS platforms are the 
most advanced in the world with the most widely used service reaching 
peaks of over 7,000 patients served in a month. With over two centuries of 
combined experience in Healthcare and technology, DOCADEMIC’s team 
understands the industry inside out. In fact, we understand it enough to 
know current healthcare methods are becoming obsolete. Large healthcare 
institutions simply cannot keep up with innovation. And we’re only just 
beginning—read on to see how we plan to grow this exponentially, and why 
our people are the ones to deliver. 

THE HEALTHCARE ACCESS PROBLEM 

Amid the massive economic activity in the healthcare industry, participants 
face many challenges. At DOCADEMIC, we have identified ONE 
fundamental element to address. It’s an element so crucial it often gets 
manipulated to the advantage of the elite... yet it’s vital to the health and 
growth of worldwide healthcare services. That element is: ACCESS. 
Healthcare Access is the lifeblood of the healthcare industry. 

Access covers short-term health solutions and basic needs of individuals— 
whether it’s associated with chronic disease or the common cold. A hospital 
can have the largest facilities in the world and the best-run medical service 
for patients, BUT, if at any point in time a patient needs immediate care, and 
is unable to reach the hospital or pay for its services, then that patient is in 
trouble. The history of the healthcare world is littered with such casualties. 
Its future doesn’t need to be. Accessibility problems triggered many of the 

M T C
�



�10
Global Health Crisis’ most traumatic events. A major recent shock occurred 
when the Ebola virus spread throughout West Africa, caused by a lack of 
knowledge and fear. The panicked reactions by residents transmuted to 
local governments, leading to the viruses further spread.

The Digital healthcare world is pouring its creative energy into this explosion 
of new Blockchain and AI Technologies and exciting business models. But 
access—that less headline-grabbing yet fundamental element—is getting 
left behind. What if an individual´s most significant healthcare service is tied 
to a specific set of rules that prevents a patient from considering seeking 
medical help, or self-medicates, without quick access to a healthcare 
provider? They could be in serious trouble. This issue already exists today. 
The largest healthcare providers in traditional healthcare are global hospital 
chains, governments and other healthcare institutions such as Keyser 
Permanente, UnitedHealth Group, and Aetna. Can DOCADEMIC achieve 
the same status in the Crypto-Health economy? We believe we can. 
Read on to find out how.

Welcome to DOCADEMIC, built to provide free 
quality basic healthcare access to the world’s 
patient population. 
DOCADEMIC is expanding DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR 
DOCTORS, a single globally-sourced healthcare platform with an 
associated suite of services which will enable the highest level of access 
and medical advancement. In the process, this will allow anybody to tap into 
all the opportunities the new Crypto-health economy has to offer. 

The DOCADEMIC Platform will be managed and operated by Sidrese SA de 
CV. established under laws of Mexico.

Currently, the accessibility landscape for patients is fragmented. The top 
healthcare providers all offer the same ways to access healthcare, and no 
one healthcare provider differentiates in any one method of access. 
Furthermore, accessibility and the best prices for a given healthcare service 
can shift from one provider to another. At any time, the best way to get 
medical attention might be in a local hospital or government service. The 
ailment may be avoided with home treatment but there is no way to find out 

M T C
�



�13
for sure and internet searches are questionable at best. The same is true for 
all patients who have chronic disease. 
In a sense, the various healthcare providers are accessibility Silos. They 
offer great service in some areas once there, but their accessibility is limited 
to clients who have the means to reach them and know of their benefits. 
While most of the healthcare providers offer easy access in certain basic 
services (ER, lab studies, etc.), there is no real-time convenient and highly-
accessible on-ramp into the healthcare world for patients of minor ailments 
or with the lack of knowledge to determine if they need to go see a 
healthcare provider. Patients such as pregnant women, patients with stage 
1 cancer, young adults, elderly, etc.
Separately, each patient´s needs may be different, but collectively they 
represent a large untapped source of clients that desperately want and need 
a qualified on-ramp into healthcare services.

The DOCADEMIC Platform brings together an entire global network of 
medical services and makes them accessible to everybody. The 
DOCADEMIC Platform through its DOCADEMIC APP provides an 
unparalleled and powerful method of orientating health services and 
products to Individuals and institutions—as well as to Token Issuers and 
Token Holders.

3.1 DOCADEMIC APP 

3.1.1 Intelligent medical assistance engine 

The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP offers an easy to use 
interface that aggregates the services of artificial intelligence’s various 
analytical benefits and assists Human Doctors who are present 24 hours a 
day into a single highly user-friendly application, allowing users to solicit 
medical assistance in the place and time of one’s choice as well as follow 
up on treatments they receive and take and share their health record 
through blockchain with doctors of their choosing: 

The DOCADEMIC APP solves two important problems that limit patients in 
the healthcare world: Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets. 

As mentioned above, Accessibility Silos are pockets of healthcare 
providers like hospitals and clinics that exist because access in certain 
locations is not readily available to those people who live far away or want 
healthcare service at hours when the accessibility silos are not operating. 
Underserved Markets are markets that, in isolation, are not wealthy 
enough to support the cost of traditional medical services. 

People in the countries that only have Accessibility Silos and Underserved 
Markets would like to be able to have full access to healthcare services in 
their home countries, but there is no highly-accessible on-ramp into the 
healthcare world for them.
 
The Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets problems are solved 
by connecting these healthcare services into a single point of access, and 
by allowing patients to be orientated to a cure at home or the correct 
healthcare providers and healthcare services.

Under the hood, the DOCADEMIC APP is a composite of two diagnostic 
services: Internal AI diagnosis: An artificial intelligence trained by our 
doctors to supplement and optimize the diagnosis of a patient’s symptoms 
derived from the information it is perceiving from the patient through speech 
and text and is constantly improved.  

External Aggregated Medical Doctor Diagnosis: A real time team of 
Doctors that have all the information we’ve learned from giving the service 
throughout several countries. Each Doctor in this service is linked to a 
system that compiles the treatments, medications and healthcare providers 
that are added to the network. 

M T C
�



�16
The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP supports giving medical 
advice in the country of one’s choice. To understand how useful this is, it is 
helpful to understand that most healthcare services in the world are 
composed of a Basic primary care (The first contact with a doctor.), and a 
Secondary care (the doctor or service you are referred to after the primary 
care doctor diagnosis you). It is also possible to get medical care at 
secondary care services and bypassing the primary care service. 

For example, a Male European patient wishing to get medical attention for a 
pain in his neck can choose to go to a pharmacy and buy pain relief 
medication. When he requests medical assistance in the DOCADEMIC APP, 
He learns that the pain may be more than just neck pain because the 
related symptoms of fatigue he describes to the doctor determine he may 
have thyroid cancer. While a Woman from Singapore, using the 
DOCADEMIC APP, can describe to the doctor her symptoms of her recent 
pregnancy and from the diagnosis that is determined through the internal 
artificial intelligence and the insight of the Doctor he acquired through use of 
the DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network, it is determined she has 
preeclampsia and should go immediately to a hospital or she runs the risk of 
losing her baby.

3.1.2 The Architecture 

Underpinning DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP are three 
technologies that are already used by DOCADEMIC daily: 

1. User matching Engine (UME) 
2. Cross diagnosis HUMAN-AI Engine (CDHAIE) 
3. Smart patient Routing (SPR)
 

User Matching Engine (UME): 

Built from scratch by combining decades of experience in programming 
technology, the DOCADEMIC APP´s User Matching Engine (UME) can 
process several million transactions per second, making it one of the most 
advanced patient matching engines in the health industry. 

M T C
�



�17
The UME has been engineered to be hyper-scalable to support a very high 
number of markets (patients from many countries) and offers native support 
for several languages, around which a powerful diagnosis System for these 
patients has been built. 

All these features, coupled with “built to fail” resiliency, make the 
DOCADEMIC APP´s UME one of the best in the healthcare market.

Cross diagnosis Human-AI Engine (CDHAIE) 

The Cross-Diagnosis Human-AI Engine allows for quick, effective and clear 
diagnosis of patients: When a patient diagnosis is initiated, and the demand 
for medical attention on the DOCADEMIC APP is high, the Doctor receives 
real time suggestions from the AI for more complete and rapid diagnosis of 
the patient on the other side of the Video Telemedicine call. For example, if 
a patient calls and starts explaining symptoms such as fatigue, running 
nose, joint pain the Doctor has multiple possible diagnosis´ for that patient. 
The CDHAIE automatically performs an analysis of the symptoms to narrow 
down the diagnostic possibilities so a more accurate diagnosis is confirmed. 
It is also constantly adjusting, in real-time, to decisions and corrections as 
well as the latest clinical guides of the doctors to reflect the best method of 
treatment and diagnosis. It should be mentioned here that this service is not 
only limited to Medical services and expands onto psychological services. 
For example, using the DOCADEMIC APP´s emotional service (Cool 
Emotions) for psychological treatment, it becomes possible to provide 
treatment between a patient and a Psychologists. 
Furthermore, adding a Psychological service allows for matches between 
Medical and Psychological treatments for wartime trauma.

Smart Patient Routing (SPR): 
The Smart Patient Routing Technology maintains quick referrals for all major 
healthcare providers throughout the countries where the services are given. 
When any of those healthcare providers changes, it’s reflected in 
DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP´s patient referral services 
database.

M T C
�



�18
When a patient referral is given on the DOCADEMIC APP, and no match is 
available locally, the Smart Patient Routing Technology checks to see if 
there is a match for the service needed available in a nearby area. If so, it 
automatically routes the patient in to the service of the neighboring region.

3.2 DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS 
The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network 
is comprised by a suite of services that provide users with tools to receive 
ongoing medical education, reduce diagnosis errors and increase ROI since 
it lowers costs for Doctors and patients. DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS 
includes an electronic health record, Digital Vademecum, and over 600 
medical journals and a social network exclusively for Doctors as its core 
offering. 
Users are now able to share their insights, receive patients, learn from the 
latest clinical procedures and use tools that integrate AI, without even 
having to pay for these services and tools or depend on their medical 
institutions to provide it for them. 

DOCADEMIC PLATFORM users will gain the following benefits: 

1. Reduction of Counterparty Risk: DOCTOR users of the 
DOCADEMIC Platform will rest assured that the information 
available is compliant with regulators. DOCADEMIC is regulated in 
the United States of America known as one of the strictest health 
regulators in the world.

2. Increase in Efficiency: DOCADEMIC Platform´s Doctor users will 
be able to update their knowledge of other treatments without 
having to search for the world´s medical journals directly. Journal 
updates will be done via DOCADEMIC´s real time posting 
technology, and should be instant for Doctors as soon as the articles 
are published. 

3. More Accurate diagnosis for their patients: Doctor Users of the 
Docademic Platform will have the ability to view and select 
diagnosis suggested by the integrated AI, derived from the different 
official clinical guides. This will allow Doctors to better take 
advantage of inefficiencies in the sometimes-slow integration of 
recent developments in treatments in the healthcare system.

3.2.1 Direct Market Access 

The Docademic Platform allows its users to leverage DOCADEMIC Smart 
Patient Routing (SPR) technology and connectivity to all reputable 
medication and medical device providers, and get Direct Market Access 
through our Docademic Marketplace to the best retailers and wholesalers of 
medication and medical devices. 
With our state-of-the-art ecommerce dashboards, users of the DOCADEMIC 
Platform will be able to purchase consumables, place orders of home 
delivery of medication, buy equipment for their practice, and keep an eye on 
all new products and services offered in medicine 24/7. 
Our Order Management System (OMS) and User Matching Engine 
(UME) provide unparalleled banking-level performance. Our OMS will 
provide both common and advanced order types like programmed 
purchases of consumables for doctor’s offices. The DOCADEMIC 
Marketplace will be a one stop shop for all medical and health related 
products and services that both patients and doctors can use.
 
3.2.2 Data Management 

Data Management is one of the most difficult (and restricted) constraints 
when it comes to providing medical services to the market. Moving health 
data between providers is convoluted, expensive and time consuming – 
which is one of the reasons Blockchain is the future of Healthcare. 

Over the past two years, DOCADEMIC has built an extensive network of 
relationships with Hospitals. Part of our integration strategy has been to co-
locate our health services with those of other health institutions, by offering 
software integration as a standard part of our service—and in many cases 
further than HL7 standard requirements—to health institutions. 

We have also begun working with major governments to provide health 
service optimization. This will allow us to replicate patient-institution data 
transfer globally. This service will also be available to private practices using 
DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS` AI assisted Electronic health record. 

M T C
�



�21
DOCADEMIC is planning to obtain any other permits or licenses when 
required.

Why is Blockchain technology important to the DOCADEMIC 
Platform?

Docademic gets patients health records on a blockchain starting with their 
first contact with a doctor through our DOCADEMIC APP. Like previously 
mentioned, the Docademic APP service is openly available to the public and 
is already in use in 20 countries and is completely free. This is the best way 
to get people onto the blockchain. If needed, the patients can be referred to 
further healthcare services or products after their first contact with a Doctor 
on the DOCADEMIC APP. All patient data secured on a blockchain.  
Eventually the Docademic Blockchain will be accessible by third party 
healthcare providers and they will be able to build apps and dapps on the 
Docademic Blockchain. More in section 4.5

Why This Innovation Matters 
for Healthcare Access 

There are many third-party healthcare providers that provide 
only limited services. The access to their services and 
efficiency are substantially constrained by the nature and 
cost of their services. By providing access to these service 
as part of our DOCADEMIC Platform, third party Healthcare 
providers will be incentivized to use the platform—because 
it will allow them to better monetize their capital by reaching 
more patients in an efficient manner targeted to their 
services. Patients data will already be on the blockchain and 
third-Party healthcare providers can benefit by having 
access to the patients data through the blockchain with 
smart contracts. In the end this provides more security for 
patient health information in the long term. The correct way 
healthcare information should be in the world.

3.2.3 Crypto Token Credit 

The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS network will 
extend its Crypto Credit facility to users to leverage their existing balances 
for enhanced purchasing opportunities. Crypto Credit facility allows Doctor 
users to borrow using MTC Crypto Token as collateral. For example, when 
buying equipment for their practice.

MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) can also be used by patients as 
collateral for purchasing certain products or services in the DOCADEMIC 
marketplace. (more on our Token in the following sections.) 

DOCADEMIC is also in the process of creating and official Provider of Care 
(PC), to expand the range of services we can offer our users in the US. 
DOCADEMIC will also obtain any other permits or licenses when required. 

3.2.4 Real Time Reporting 

The DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS users will have access to customized 
patient activity statements, to view detailed information about their patient’s 
treatments including progress, previous treatments, most common 
medication taken, and more. They will be able to run reports to view all 
aspects of their complete patient portfolios 

3.3 Other Services
 
3.3.1 Geo-Location System 

Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides geographic health monitoring 
(GHM) of population in real time as well as our powerful direct targeted 
notification system (DTN)—or near constant statistical public health 
monitor within our network to our public health partners. 

We provide support for epidemics and tragedies. Users of the DOCADEMIC 
Platform will be able to be contacted by public health officials with up to date 

M T C

�24
information pertaining to their specific health need in the case of an 
emergency or receive information from preventative health campaigns.

�

3.3.2 Automated Follow up of treatments 

Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides follow up to the most recent treatments 
given to patients. Users can select from scale of automated one touch 
treatment scores to evaluate their progress, then have their health 
monitored by our Doctors using these strategies. New strategies will be 
published and will be accessible by our users. Historical health records, 
performance and other details derived from these treatments follow up 
strategies will be available to users to aid them in the improvement of their 
health or the improvement of their patients’ health. 

Initially, these follow up and health monitoring strategies will be provided by 
DOCADEMIC. However, the platform, certain data, and tools we use will be 
made available to data scientists with MTC throughout the industry, allowing 
access to any individual or teams with the talent/skill to design and offer 
their own health monitoring strategies. 

M T C
�



�25
Examples of follow up strategy use cases: 

1. MTC token holders can use automated treatment Follow up 
strategies to save on purchases of medications pertaining to their 
treatment. 
2. Talented Doctors can design their own treatment combination 
strategies for their patients and then use them to improve their own 
patient’s health—or share them publicly for a share of the profits 
and/or a fee in case other doctors or healthcare providers want to 
adopt the treatment strategy. 
3. MTC Token holders can select one or a basket of Treatments 
strategies and then have their treatments automatically monitored. 

Automated Treatment Strategies will be provided only to the extent 
permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules and medical ethics.

4.1 Token Overview 
The Crypto economy has given us a whole new way to build new distributed 
infrastructure using Crypto Tokens. People are coming together to 
contribute to something they truly want, something they truly believe in. And 
as Token Holders, they are benefiting from the growth in its utility and value. 
DOCADEMIC, through MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC), is building a 
healthcare utility—a platform that the entire Crypto economy and Healthcare 
economy will benefit from and where people can participate in as both users 
and token holders. 

MTC will be issued by Sidrese Sa. De CV. and may be distributed by itself 
and/or designated distributors. Please note that MTC does not represent 
any equity in DOCADEMIC and does not entitle holders to any voting rights, 
dividends or profit-sharing of any entities of DOCADEMIC. MTC is a Crypto 
Token that can be used as the fuel that powers all services provided by the 
DOCADEMIC Platform and DOCADEMICS’s existing services 
(DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS). 

MTC has three main functions:  
1. As Crypto Token users can pay for products and services on all 
our platforms; 
2. As the currency that interacts with the blockchain docademic 
stores patient and healthcare data in.
3. As a tradable Crypto Token on the open market. 

On top of these, MTC will open to all healthcare, financial and any other 
industries. DOCADEMIC will not limit the usage of MTC nor business 
entities that would like to use MTC for their business. Therefore, any 
companies or organizations, individuals may be able to utilize MTC as a 
Crypto Token such as Bitcoin, Ethereum’s ETH and Ripple’s XRP.  As the 
demand for the DOCADEMIC Platform grows, the utility of MTC will 
increase and will allow MTC holders to use its value to “pay for” all services 
and functions DOCADEMIC and its partners will provide.

M T C
�



�28
We envision MTC could even become the preferred 
standard Token used to pay for all services provided by the 
broader Healthcare industry, as participants gradually 
migrate to decentralized platforms.

DOCADEMIC is already in discussion with multiple healthcare institutions, 
Digital Health startups, and partners to make MTC the preferred payment 
Token for upcoming and existing Healthcare services. 

4.1.1 Token Utility
 Initially, MTC value will be used for services provided by the DOCADEMIC 
Platform and DOCADEMIC—to cover fees, as credit collateral, and to 
participate in further development of services like the DOCADEMIC 
Marketplace. Also patient data stored on the blockchain will only be able to 
be accessed by spending MTC. 
Since through the Docademic App we load new patient information onto the 
blockchain everyday throughout the world access to this anonymized data 
will be very useful for governments, research institutions, companies etc. 
We reward doctors and patients that contribute to the data that is inputted 
onto the blockchain with MTC and charge whoever accesses the Data with 
MTC.

4.1.2 Listed Tradable Assets 

MTC will be tradable on popular trading platforms. Having MTC listed on 
various exchanges is another way we expect the Token utility to increase 
with liquidity.

4.6 Docademic Blockchain
 
MTC token will initially be built on top of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token 
Standard. 
By Q2 2019, Docademic will create its own blockchain (Docademic 
BLOCKCHAIN) that will have specific Healthcare industry requirements 
already built in. Currently, none of the existing blockchains (including 
Ethereum) offer sophisticated tools to build any meaningful or scalable 
Healthcare services on top of their blockchains (other than basic services 
such as payments and transfers). 

All DOCADEMIC services will be migrated to the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN 
and the existing ERC- 20 based MTC will also be exchanged to the newly 
created MC (Medical Cryptocurrency) on the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN. 
The Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will provide a more sophisticated Healthcare 
industry programming language for the design and construction of smart 
contracts that will allow Healthcare institutions and Digital Health startups to 
build decentralized Healthcare services on top of the Docademic 
BLOCKCHAIN.
When we launch in Q2 2019, the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will have the 
following features: 

1. KYC/AML 
2. Node Management (Region Restrictions) 
3. Healthcare Service Features 

Date From March 06 18:00:00 GMT

to April 06 18:00:00 GMT

Bonus No bonus during crowd sale
INITIAL PRICE 1 MTC = 0.000035 ETH

HARDCAP 12250 ETH

M T C
�



�34
Docademic is creating a Healthcare services based blockchain that will be 
powered by MC. As more Healthcare services utilize the Docademic 
blockchain, we anticipate MC becoming the cryptocurrency of choice by a 
growing ecosystem of healthcare service providers thus causing the utility of 
MC to grow.

Who Benefits

M T C
�



�36

5.1 Individual and Institutional investors 
Access to Great Technology 
Over the years, Docademic has built state-of-the-art, high-availability, and 
high-performance technology for free accessibility to basic medical 
healthcare and Services. This includes Smart Patient Routing (SPR) and 
Order Management System(OMS) technology to Match patients with our 
doctors 24/7 through Video Telemedicine, in addition to a powerful suite of 
tools with integrated AI for the medical community covering all relevant 
Medical Specialties. Individual patients now have a free quick easy to use 
option to get basic medical attention face to face with a Doctor and Doctors 
have tools that help them in their everyday practice.
 
Access to the worlds health services and products. 
The ever-increasing number of Digital health services presents both a 
significant opportunity and a challenge to reach these services for investors 
and traders alike. Between USD 1 and 2 trillion in transactions are done 
daily in across millions of healthcare providers. This presents a sizeable 
opportunity for traders and investors who want to tap into the value that can 
be obtained with decentralized healthcare services. 
The chart below shows healthcare spending in the worlds markets 
according to the world bank.

M T C
�



�37
Reduced Risk 
The challenge lies in having access to all healthcare services in an efficient 
and secure manner, with as little difficulty of data transmission as possible. 
At the time of writing, it is quite difficult (even impossible) to fully take 
advantage of these opportunities due to several factors. These range from 
technology limitations, healthcare data restrictions, unreasonable prices, 
capital inefficiency, and an overall lack of clear integration. 
DOCADEMIC through its integrated plan to use its current technologies and 
MTC tokens provide a solution that takes advantage of Blockchain and 
Artificial intelligence to achieve an efficient on-ramp for customers to 
healthcare products and services.

Access to Professional-Grade Services 
The services that the DOCADEMIC Platform offers are already powerful 
when used on their own, but they can have a much stronger impact when 
coupled with our Medical ecommerce platform, direct targeted 
notification system, and sophisticated reporting tools. 

Access to all health services the DOCADEMIC Platform provides will no 
longer be the exclusive privilege of the few. 
We are launching a fully open, super-connected platform that will allow 
anybody, anywhere to participate and benefit from the Healthcare services 
that new digital health markets and current Healthcare providers have to 
offer. 
This is real democratization of Health.

5.2 Token Holders
  
The DOCADEMIC Platform will also provide token holders with the 
following additional services: 

Crypto Lending 
Token holders may lend their Crypto Tokens for a fee at DOCADEMIC. 
Doing so adds liquidity to the MTC market, by providing the necessary 
inventory for Healthcare providers such as Doctors who require purchasing 

M T C
�



�38
goods and services related to their practice. This increases the overall 
liquidity of MTC. 

5.3 Financial Services Innovators and Society 
at Large
 
Cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain/distributed ledger 
technologies are a key facilitator for many of the applications, products and 
services being introduced as part of the irreversible wave of innovation 
currently taking place in the Healthcare services and Digital Health 
industries. 
This wave of new innovations, sometimes referred to as, “the Digital Health 
Revolution”, promises to completely disrupt traditional Healthcare services 
on all fronts. It will ultimately.

Bring better, faster, cheaper healthcare services to everyone, including the 
world’s estimated more than 4 billion with no access to healthcare at all. 
There are also countless Doctors and health services who can’t get credit 
using traditional banking, due to lack of credit histories and other reasons. 

DOCADEMIC’s global network of Health services and healthcare industry 
connections, regulatory licenses, and compliance/security frameworks can 
fill the gaps for many of the existing Digital Health models for intra-country 
and international health services.

 
We envision MTC to become the preferred token that can 
be used in the broader Healthcare industry to power 
healthcare services as they migrate to decentralized 
platforms.

Competitive 
Advantage

6.1 World Class Team 
We have assembled a world class team with over 200 years of combined 
experience in Healthcare and Technology. 
Our team has a proven track record in IT, Hospital management, 
Pharmaceutical Industry, Emergency Care, Clinical Research, Legal and 
regulatory—all combined with expertise in Internet and mobile technology. 
Most notably, we have built DOCADEMIC APP—one of the largest Video 
Telemedicine services in the world with users in 20 countries. It is fully 
aligned with the requirements of most regulated markets around the world. 

DOCADEMIC’s management team has worked at the following 
companies and institutions:
 

• Healthcare Institutions:  ISSSTE, Stanford Research Institute, 
COFEPRIS, Astra Zeneca, Nestle Pharma, Carnot Laboratories
• Internet and Technology: NETMARK, IPN
• Others: SEP, Televisa 

6.2 Product Readiness
 
Our core product development is already completed. There is zero risk on 
core product development. 

The DOCADEMIC Platform: 

• Is on the App Store and Play Store and currently has users in 20 
countries with medical assistances of over 7,000 on peak months. 
•Provides an unparalleled and powerful suite of AI-assisted tool for 

Doctors and a social network for the medical community.

The world needs free basic access to healthcare and we are 
solving a fundamental problem. We will continuously 
improve our products using our cutting-edge technologies. 

M T C
�



�41
We know how to scale. We built DOCADEMIC APP to 
become one of the most widely used Video Telemedicine 
services in world. Our Product-Market fit is clear.

As is the case with all startups, though, 90% of companies will unfortunately 
fail during product development and product-market fit stages. However, 
DOCADEMIC is already past that risk zone. 

6.3 Healthcare provider and Government 
Relationships 
Over the past four years, DOCADEMIC has built and connected with global 
healthcare companies and governments—which the DOCADEMIC Platform 
is able to leverage. The amount of work (resources, regulation, professional 
services) makes our DOCADEMIC Platform truly unique.

M T C
�



�42
 
We have been able to build these relationships as we are fully compliant, 
regulated, and have never experienced any significant incidents of 
information theft on any of our existing platforms (both DOCADEMIC APP 
and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS). 

6.4 Regulated in the USA and LatAm and soon 
Rest of World.
DOCADEMIC’s parent company Sidrese Sa. de CV. operates a fully-
regulated Video telemedicine service and we were the first global 
Telemedicine service to have users in 20 countries.

DOCADEMIC’s regulatory team from Foley Lardner (Top Tier Healthcare 
law firm) ensures we are within regulations in the US. Foley Lardner was 
Named "Law Firm of the Year – Health Care Law" for three Consecutive 
Years by U.S. News.

DOCADEMIC’s team from international Law firm Hogan Lovells ensured the 
correct legal and regulatory compliance in LatAm.

Combined these two world Class firms with International reach process and 
design our legal and regulatory compliant structures for the rest of the world.

6.5 Compliance and Security 
We are proud that DOCADEMIC’s products are compliant services in the 
Digital Health and Telemedicine space. With Foley Lardner and Hogan 
Lovells as our team of compliance counsel, an independent internal auditor, 
compliance training for all employees, and an annual compliance plan 
agreed by our Risk Management Committee and carried out by our entire 
senior management team.
we have built a culture of compliance within DOCADEMIC. 

M T C
�



�43
We recognize the risks of medical malpractice and low-quality healthcare 
services, and we continuously strive to enhance our program to be the 
leading example of best practices in the Digital Health world. 

This culture is what allowed us to offer our services and receive stellar 
reviews from people from multiple countries, where others have not. No 
other Digital Health company has this much reach and depth, especially in 
Video Telemedicine. 

DOCADEMIC strictly complies with clinical guidelines when we operate in 
jurisdictions where telemedicine is not yet subject to specific regulation. We 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which 
we operate. 

On the Security and Privacy side, we took our years of experience working 
with government-grade security and combined it with the most up-to-date 
tools and techniques to leapfrog traditional Digital health institutions. 
We have achieved a new healthcare-grade security program covering all the 
key security domains.

These are: 
1. Access Control. 
2. Cryptography. 
3. Information Security Governance and Risk Management. 
4. Legal Regulations, Investigations and Compliance. 
5. Operations Security. 
6. Physical and Environmental Security. 
7. Security Architecture and Design. 
8. Telecommunications and Network Security. 

In addition to our internal team, processes and tools – plus the state-of-the-
art external security tools and services we use—we will engage specialized 
external penetration testers and even crowd-sourced penetration testing 
services to stay ahead of would-be attackers. This protects the 
confidentiality, availability and integrity of our systems, information—and 
ultimately our users.

At DOCADEMIC, security is a 24/7 activity. It’s 
everybody’s responsibility, managed by our Risk 
Management Committee which is comprised of our 
senior managers from all areas of the business, and 
supported by state-of-the-art technologies and tools.

LEGAL
GENERAL INFORMATION
This whitepaper describes the initial sale in which the MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) is sold. MTC is a crypto 
token that is designed to be used for all services provided by the DOCADEMIC platform as explained in this 
whitepaper. MTC also can be used as a Crypto Token to pay for any other services provided by other business 
entities. DOCADEMIC will generally not limit the usage of MTC or the types of business entities that would like to use 
MTC for their business. 
MTC is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction. This white paper is not a solicitation for investment and 
does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. 
Please note that purchases of MTC are final and non-refundable.
Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring 
MTC.

LIMITATION OF THE PURCHASERS
You are not eligible to and you shall not purchase MTC through its token sale if you are a citizen or resident (tax or 
otherwise) of any country or state where the purchase of MTC or similar Crypto Token may be prohibited, or the token 
sale is deemed to be not compliant with the applicable laws and regulations. If you are a resident of People’s Republic 
of China you cannot purchase MTC through the token sale.
Purchases of MTC should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have extensive experience 
with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of Crypto Tokens and blockchain based software systems. 
Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other 
Crypto Tokens. Any entities of DOCADEMIC and officers and employees thereof will not be responsible in any way for 
loss of any Crypto Tokens, MTC or fiat currency resulting from actions taken by, or omissions of the purchasers. If you 
do not have the required experience or expertise, then you should not purchase MTC or participate in the sale of 
MTC.
You should carefully consider the risks, costs, and any other demerits of acquiring MTC, and, if necessary, obtain your 
own independent advice in this regard. If you are not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated 
with the token sale of MTC (including the risks related to the non-development of the DOCADEMIC platform) or any 
other risks as indicated in this whitepaper, you should not acquire MTC, until such that you have received the 
necessary independent advice.

RISKS
The purchase of MTC carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MTC, the purchaser should carefully consider 
the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional prior to 
determining whether to purchase MTC.

(a) MTC will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the 
purchaser. If a purchaser of MTC does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead 
to the loss of MTC. If your password protection is weak and it is cracked or learned by somebody else, 
this may also lead to the loss of MTC. As a result, purchasers must safely store their password in one or 
more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. 
(b) The purchaser recognizes that some of the services under the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM are 
currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The purchaser 
acknowledges that any of its expectations regarding the form and functionality of the DOCADEMIC 
PLATFORM may not be met for any number of reasons.
(c) The purchaser understands that while DOCADEMIC will make best efforts to connect the 
DOCADEMIC PLATFORM to most of the major healthcare services in the world, it is possible that some 
healthcare services may decline the connection with the DOCADEMIC Platform, which may result in the 
less sharing of patient data and offering of certain health services in certain regions provided through the 
DOCADEMIC PLATFORM than expected in this whitepaper.
(d) The purchaser understands that while DOCADEMIC will make best efforts to release the next wave of 
services of the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM on time, it is possible that the official release may be delayed.
(e) As with other Crypto Tokens, value of MTC may fluctuate significantly and become reduced in value 
for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall Crypto Tokens’ 
market conditions, political or geographical reasons, changes of regulations in any jurisdictions, and 
technical reasons.

M T C
�



�58
(f) MTC will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning 
of the Ethereum protocol may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold MTC. Such 
impact could adversely affect the value of MTC.

DISCLAIMER 1.1
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, MTC, any entities of DOCADEMIC 
and officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other 
losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and 
loss of use or data), arising out of or relating to any acceptance of or reliance on this whitepaper or any part thereof by 
you.
Any entities of DOCADEMIC and officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for your loss of MTC after it is 
transferred to you by any reason including but not limited to your failure to maintain or backup an accurate record of 
your password or password cracking by somebody due to your poor maintenance of your password. 
DOCADEMIC will do its best to launch its operations and further develop the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM. Any person 
undertaking to acquire MTC acknowledges and understands however that DOCADEMIC does not provide with any 
warranty as to the release of newer services of the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM. They acknowledge and understand 
therefore that DOCADEMIC (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or 
damage that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use the MTC.
