1. Preamble  

Not only business people and politicians, but also consumers have been realizing lately that our 

economies and societies are undergoing dramatic changes due to the so-called “digitalization”. The term 

“digitalization” refers to a variety of different phenomena with a strong impact on our daily life’s and the 

way value is created in our economies. The future research company “Z-Punkt” uses another term and 

writes about “Connected Reality 2025”.1  

A major trend that is currently turning the “Connected Reality 2025” into reality is the “Internet of Things”. 

It is a “network of internet-connected objects able to collect and exchange data using embedded 

sensors.2” An example which is repeated quite often in public discussions is the refrigerator, which is 

connected to the Internet and can autonomously order fresh food if necessary. But the Internet of Things 

is far more: Based on the rapidly decreasing costs of high-performance sensors literally everything can be 

equipped with a sensor and get connected.  

 

Cyber-Security has many facets. It plays a crucial role in all kinds of contexts. 

� When many employees use their smart phones from work for private purposes as well, who can     

make sure that confidential information is truly secure? 

 

� When large corporations collecting vast amounts of data start working together, who can 

guarantee that they do not become too powerful and use their knowledge to exploit or blackmail 

consumers? 

 

� When factories and power plants with all their highly sensitive and confidential data get 

connected to the Internet of Things, who will make sure that the competition or criminals do not 

get access?

In this world of total interconnection of everyone and everything, 

“Cyber-security” becomes a main driver

A study conducted by the American Company Raytheon outlines, that 2/3 of all enterprises are not ready 

to protect billions of cyber-vulnerable devices3.The different purposes of cyber-security in an 

interconnected world will occupy researchers and entrepreneurs for years to come. 

 

  

We will discuss the main risks, but also the opportunities of cyber-security, especially before the 

background of the game-changing technological revolution of Blockchain. What is the blockchain and 

what does it do?  

According to the Oxford Dictionaries, the blockchain is “A digital ledger in which transactions made in 

bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.”4 It provides a secure way of 

“making and recording transactions, agreements and contracts – anything that needs to be recorded and 

verified as having taken place. 

But the blockchain is not kept in one place only, it is distributed across a network of computers. It could 

be a dozen, a hundred or even thousands of people. The digital ledger becomes an extensive list of 

transactions, getting bigger and bigger. 

How can this technology be used for cyber-security purposes? 

The blockchain automatically distributes information among the entire network. Nobody can make 

alterations to the information without being noticed and “stopped” by the network. This means that 

external attackers would have to gain access to every computer in the network that hosts the blockchain 

database at the same time to manipulate it, which is regarded as practically impossible.

Blockchain technology has become known to a wider public in 2008 because of the crypto-currency 

Bitcoin. But the use-cases for this technology do not only include financial transactions, but a wide range 

of interesting fields of business. 

In this whitepaper, we will outline our vision of more secure interaction in communication networks and 

beyond based on blockchain technology and our specific approach to cyber-security and confidentiality. 

Waldemar Konradi, CEO of Crypviser 

 

 

2. Executive Summary 

The key take-aways of this whitepaper are the following: 

A) Our societies and economies are facing a technological revolution. 
 In an interconnected world, cyber-security becomes crucial both to individuals as well as to 

enterprises. As of now, most individuals and companies are not prepared to provide sufficient 

security regarding their communication. Crypviser intends to change that. 

 

B) The Blockchain can revolutionize many businesses and markets. 
 It has an enormous potential regarding cyber security. Crypviser uses blockchain technology to 

develop bullet-proof solutions for B2C and B2B markets. By providing genuine encryptions key 

identification, Crypviser can prevent any kind of manipulation, interceptions and “man-in-the-

middle” (MITM) attacks on all communication levels. 

 

C) Crypviser products and solutions are based on the underlying thought of 

creating an eco-system of safe interaction for consumers as well as business 

customers.  
The business opportunities today are diverse. Crypviser intends to be positioned as a pioneer and 

thought leader regarding blockchain usage for cyber-security purposes for instant 

communication networks. 

 

A market assessment estimated that $1 bln. has been invested in 

blockchain technology in 2016 alone1.

3. The idea: Introduction to the world of encrypted interaction 

3.1. How can encryption be easier and at the same time strong and professional?  

Ever since the emergence of Bitcoin, the crypto-community has been growing. Nonetheless, the crypto-

community is only a small target group of technically highly competent people with a strong web-affinity. 

Crypviser has developed an unbeatable security model, which is professionally designed to meet the 

highest standards of cryptography for securely exchanging and storing all kinds of data. 

 

. 

To make our vision come true, we are committed to two major pillars of our ideology: 

� The development of easy-to-use, user-centric products and solutions interesting for a wide range 

of markets and purposes 

 

� The approach of thought leadership (including publications like this whitepaper but also 

participation at notable events), informing the public and investors about the potential of our 

technology  

 

3.2. What are the main benefits of a more secure interaction?  

The advantages of a more secure interaction are diverse. There are all kinds of crucial information that 

should be kept confidential. Here are some examples: 

 

� Consumers want their personal information to be safe, for example their address, credit card 

number or car key frequency.  

 

� Government institutions are dealing with all kinds of sensitive information daily, for instance tax 

information.  

 

 

The vision of Crypviser is to make encrypted interaction 

understandable for the public and available for the mass market 



  

7 

 

� Insurances and attorneys have gathered vast amounts of confidential data, for example 

regarding the financial or legal issues of their customers.  

 

� Medical institutions need to protect and securely exchange all confidential information related to 

the patients according to the laws of most countries. 

 

� Financial organizations mostly dealing and exchanging with top - secret financial and brokerage 

data related to their customers and partners. Leakage of this kind of data could cause serious 

financial damage and is a reputational risk. 

 

� Businesses have a strong demand in keeping technical specifications of their most important 

products and services confidential, because the success of their business depends on this 

information. 

 

3.3. Who needs confidential interaction? 

As indicated above, confidential interaction may benefit a large variety of different target groups. The 

following scenarios are helpful to outline the benefits of encrypted communication for different 

stakeholders: 

 

� A casual user 
Imagine an average person, who is annoyed of the lack of security in the contemporary popular 

social networks. Someone who would appreciate it a lot if their information, for example private 

pictures at the beach, are protected properly. 

 

� A wealthy businessman 
He wants to communicate safely with his children who are currently studying abroad. Since he has 

had threats of kidnapping before, he needs an easy-to-use communication solution, which keeps 

sensitive information like the whereabouts of his children confidential. 

 

� A middle-class business owner 
He works hard to create highly complex technical products for specialized B2B purposes. Due to 

industrial espionage, his company has already suffered devastating economic losses. A highly 

secure communication solution is needed immediately. It should be easy to implement (e.g. cloud 

service). 

 

� A CEO/CTO at a large corporation 
This gentleman runs large `factories that produce state-of-the-art batteries. The products are 

dangerous themselves and should never fall into the wrong hands. Therefore, this person needs a  



  

8 

 

solution for highly encrypted communication and data exchange which can be integrated into 

already available systems. 

 

� A government official 
This lady is responsible for the management of highly sensitive data, for example regarding 

military international affairs. She needs a partner with a proven track record of excellence in 

creating encrypted communication solutions. 

 

4. Security challenges in communication networks 

4.1. Current security issues in communication networks 

Today, the most popular communication networks for instant data exchange, such as GSM, Skype, 

WeChat, Slack, Google Talk, Facebook etc., do not provide an adequate level of protection and privacy. 

Classical schemes of such systems mainly mean data exchange between parties in an unprotected way. 

 

 

Figure 1: Security challenges in an unprotected network  

Such communication models are a serious threat to safety, integrity 

and privacy of the transmitted information 



  

9 

 

As shown in Figure 1, an open unprotected system is subject to three main types of attacks: 

 

1.) Leakage of user’s data to third parties voluntarily or accidentally due to the provider. 

 

2.) Threat of unauthorized interception of data exchange between parties (Alice and Bob) from the 

intruder EVA. 

 

3.) The "man-in-the-middle" is an attack, during which an intruder intercepts and substitutes 

information, transmitted between Alice and Bob. As a result, Bob thinks that he talks with Alice, 

and Alice thinks that she shares data with Bob, but in fact data could be intercepted and 

replaced by the "man-in-the-middle", who can act on the behalf of Bob and Alice accordingly.  

 

 

 

        Figure 2: PKI security model 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.2. Classic model of an encrypted 

network 

To protect against the above types of threats in 

communication networks, classic cryptographic 

protocols and technologies are mainly used (such 

as SSL, VPN, PPTP, SRTP etc.,) based on asymmetric 

data encryption standards and keys exchange. 

In such models the data exchange is performed in 

an encrypted form, which eliminates the possibility 

of data interception. It also eliminates the threat 

from the intruder EVA. Even if the encrypted data is 

intercepted, it cannot be decrypted without the 

keys. 

 

However, the main types of threats, such as "deliberate leakage of 

data" and "man-in-the-middle attack" remain in effort, as encryption 

is performed on the Provider's server side 



  

10 

 

It follows that classical server-based peer-to-peer encryption models are suitable for use only in 

corporate networks, by using internal CAs (Certificate Authorities), but not in public or cloud-based 

(untrusted) networks. Although using of CA servers prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, but the servers 

itself are vulnerable for different kind of attacks.5 

Public-key cryptography may be vulnerable to impersonation, even if users' private keys are not 

available. A successful attack on a certification authority will allow an adversary to impersonate whomever 

he or she chooses by using a public-key certificate from the compromised authority to bind a key of the 

adversary's choice to the name of another user. 

 

4.3 End-to-End user-side encryption technology  

To eliminate the threat from the provider's side and to exclude it from the encryption process, today 

many platforms use the popular end-to-end user-side encryption based on asymmetric encryption 

protocols. The technology involves generating a secret and a public key on a local device for each user. In 

this case, all types of data transmitted are encrypted by two keys at the same time — a secret and a public 

one. The public key is used for data encryption and it can be freely transmitted over the network between 

users. For data decryption, the secret key is used, which is always kept on the user side and never leaves 

its device. The pair of secret and public keys has a stiff mathematical relation, so that data can be 

decrypted only if the both keys are available. Since the secret key is never transmitted and is kept on the 

user's device only, the data can be decrypted only by the recipient whose public key was used for data 

encryption. 

Figure 3: End - to – End encryption scheme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           

 

 

 



  

11 

 

However, since the provider's server acts as a trusted party of data and public keys exchange between the 

users Alice and Bob, there is still the threat of "man-in-the-middle" attack. In this case, the server can 

intercept public keys and replace them with its own and start acting on behalf of one of the users, thereby 

manipulating data between them.  

 

 

Such models are mostly used in enterprise and cloud-public networks, for instance SIMSme messenger 

by Deutsche Post, which has such vulnerability.  

 

 

5. The technology: CSMP blockchain-based security protocol 

 

5.1. Cryptography model  

Crypviser has developed a unified secure instant communication network with real end-to-end encryption 

and unique blockchain based authentication. It is a comprehensive new generation communication 

platform, which meets modern challenges for information security and increased demand for data privacy 

and protection in instant data exchange networks. It features reliable protection at all layers. 

 

 

The major drawback of this scheme is the lack of ability to identify 

user’s public keys and confirm their authenticity, which allows the 

"man in the middle" attacks on the provider side 

The main technological solution is the genuine user-side encryption 

and blockchain-based public key authentication mechanism provided 

by the CSMP protocol 



  

12 

 

Figure 4: CSMP protocol 

 

 

5.2. Blockchain-authentication method 

The encryption keys exchange, distribution and management algorithms (authentication process) is the 

most important phase in any cryptographic model. Without a properly designed authentication model, 

the encryption looks like a house with a strong armored front door, but with open windows. It’s hard to 

get inside the house through the front door, but easy to climb through unprotected windows. So, the 

security model of the most popular instant exchange networks looks like this house. 

 

 
 

Crypviser introduces the solution of the biggest historical challenge 

of asymmetric cryptography: Public-keys decentralized distribution 

based on Blockchain technologies 



  

13 

 

A blockchain-based authentication model allows users to truly identify and confirm each other's public 

keys. This eliminates the MITM threat and any kind of manipulation attempts from the server and third 

parties' sides. 

 

The algorithm: The idea is based on the Blockchain features of decentralized distribution and 

management of the public keys.  

Since the Blockchain is decentralized database, it contains information on the correspondence of the 

unique identifier of each user and the first half of his public key (id: first_half (PK)). Crypviser's server 

(CV-server) contains information about the correspondence between the unique user ID and the value of 

the second half of its public key (id: second_half (PK)). 

Initial authentication: During the account registration process, the Crypviser app generates a unique ID 

value and initial secret SK (Shared Key) on the user's local device. The public key is derived from the SK. 

These keys are permanently used for initial authentication purposes only. The CV-server, which operates 

as a node of Blockchain, has its own key pair. 

Account registration: After completion of the registration process a new key-pair is generated on the 

user's device related to the account. At the same time, a unique hash of CrypID is generated based on the 

different sources of entropy, such as partial hashes of symmetric key used for local database protection 

and user's passphrase.  The second part of the public key, CrypID and User ID (id: second_half 

(PK):CrypID) are transmitted to the CV-server using the established secure connection.                                                               

The User ID which was generated during the initial authentication phase, is intended for providing 

anonymity on the CV-server side. 

Blockchain integration: To record the first half of the initial public key to Blockchain, the user executes a 

transaction (sends authentication tokens) in favor of the CV-Server. The transaction contains meta-data 

with value of the first_half (PK) which is recorded in Blockchain ledger. Afterward the recorded part of the 

user PK must be verified on the CV-server and user sides to eliminate any MITM attack attempts during 

the transmitting the half-part of the PK through the network. Only the owner of the secret key can 

"spend" the tokens by solving the special cryptographic "problem" related to the complex calculations 

with CrypID. This means that CV-Server proves the validity of the first part of the user PK recorded into 

the Blockchain. To prove and validate the first part of PK recorded in Blockchain on the user side, CV-

Server similarly sends authentication tokens to the user. The Crypviser app performs the same algorithms 

to validate the authenticity of the recorded part of its PK.  In this way, the CV-server and user verify the 

authenticity of ledger, ensured by other nodes through the data distribution feature the half-part of user's 

initial PK at the same time in the ledger, ensured by other nodes through the data distribution feature.

Figure 6: Public-key distribution through Blockchain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Public-key authentication: The algorithm of the public-key distribution and validation between parties is 

shortly described below: 

 



  

15 

 

 

1. Party A wants to initiate a new encrypted session and sends a message containing: 

(Nonce_A, timestamp_A) 

 

2. Party B sends the following response: 

(Nonce_B, timestamp_B,E[(timestamp_A, Nonce_A, id_В, 

hash(id:РК_В))SK_B]CrypID_В)SK_B,  

 

Where, E[(timestamp_A, Nonce_A,id_B, hash(id:РК_В))SK_B]CrypID_В is the output of the encrypted 

data with CrypID belonging to Party B. It is important to note that the data is first signed by Party B's key 

and then encrypted. 

 

3. User A receives the message and forwards it as a request to the CV-Server through the secured TLS 

channel 

E[(timestamp_А, Nonce_A,id_В, hash(id: РК_В))SK_B]CrypID_В), 

 

4. The CV-server with the CrypID of Party B, decrypts the ciphertext and verifies that Party B's ID stored 

locally matches the its ID derived from the decrypted data; 



  

16 

 

5. Then it receives the first part of PK from the Blockchain ledger by the ID of Party B and combines it with 

the second-part of PK stored in local database, as well as checks the digital signature of the received data. 

6.The CV-server signs the message with its secret key, encrypts it with the A Party's CrypID and sends the 

following data to the Party A: 

E[(‘OK’, timestamp_А, Nonce_A,id_B,hash(id: РК_В),  

second_half(РК_В))SK_S]CrypID_A. 

 

7. Once it receives the message, Party A performs the following actions: 

- decrypts the data received from the CV-server and checks the digital signature; 

 - compares the values of timestamp_A and Nonce_A with those previously sent to the Party B. The value 

of timestamp_A should be in the allowable timeframe but the Nonce_A value should match. 

 

 

 

8. Party A requests the Blockchain and gets the first part of PK which belongs to Party B.  

- derive the whole public Key of Party B by combining the received part of PK from Blockchain and from 

the CV-server  

- checks the digital signature of the entire package received from user B earlier; 

- calculates hash (id:РК_В)) and compares it with the hash value of data received from the CV-server.  

 

9. In case of successful completion of all validations, Party A considers that PK_B originally belongs to 

Party B. Then Party A sends to party B the following message  

E[(timestamp_В, Nonce_В,id_А, hash(id:РК_А))SK_A]CrypID_А 

 

Party B follows the same algorithm to obtain and authenticate the public key of party A. 

Secure communication:  

All further transactions of encryption keys derivation required for the CSMP protocol to establish a secure 

communication channel between parties is held through Blockchain. It allows to keep permanent 

automated control of the security model through integrated smart intrusion detection system or having 

manually transparent access to any transaction for investigation purposes.

5.3. Security core  

Figure 7: Security levels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.4. Blockchain-based server authorization   

As is known, in security issues all details matter and play an important role. This is the reason that the 

classic client-server authorization technologies became unsuitable and do not meet current security 

requirements. Crypviser cares of its users in a professional manner and introduces a patent-pending 

complex authorization solution to prevent any possibility of the user's meta-data manipulation on the 

service provider side. 

Unlike conventional user authentication algorithms used in most of the known networks, the unique user 

identifier in the Crypviser Network - CrypID is generated locally on the user side, and then transmitted to 

the Blockchain. CrypID is generated using an innovative cryptographic algorithm, by using various sources 

of entropy, which provides the highest degree of uniqueness and avoids mathematical collisions. 

Moreover, for every user connection, a one-time session authorization token is generated based on 

CrypID, which is used and compared locally, to identify the user on the server. The session authorization 

token is destroyed after the session termination. This measure eliminates any possibility of manipulation 

with unique user CrypID on the Crypviser servers. 

 

5.5. Local security  

All kind of data is stored on the user device in a standalone encrypted storage, independent from the 

base OS such as Android or iOS. Crypviser's data storage is protected by a symmetric 256 bit encryption 

key, generated based on the user’s finger-motions, during the application installation. In the same time, 



  

18 

 

the symmetric key is protected with a passphrase defined by user. Thereby, even in case of physical 

leakage of protected database or the loss of control over the device, all sensitive data will be kept safe 

and untouchable. 

However, to provide the highest level of usability, Crypviser's users can securely save the local storage's 

password through the patent-pending multi-level HASH encryption method. Which means, that some 

part of cryptographic hash isn’t stored locally, but calculated automatically based on a unique algorithm 

for each device. 

 

5.6. The key advantages of our technology at a glance  

Crypviser has essential advantages and is the first to introduce a range of disruptive solutions: 

Blockchain authentication - automated Blockchain based authentication and verification to prevent all 

kinds of MITM attacks
