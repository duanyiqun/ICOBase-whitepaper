EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PECUNIO - BLOCKCHAIN INVESTMENTS SAFE AND EASY

Pecunio is a decentralized investment platform that focuses on blue-chip blockchain assets with unique value 
proposition and high performance potential.

Our products and services cover the whole lifecycle of blockchain innovation: From angel & venture capital 
investments (AC & VC) and initial coin offerings (ICO), to cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.

A DECENTRALIZED INVESTMENT PLATFORM AND EXCHANGE
By tokenizing all our funds and assets, we simplify safe investments into selected blockchain assets. All 
major cryptocurrencies will be interchangeable on our platform. What’s revolutionary about the platform 
is that it solves the problem of crypto spending and allows management of crypto assets in a safe and 
easy way.

ASSET-BACKED GOLD TOKEN
Gold has always been the world’s best hedge against all sort of market turmoil. Our first product in 
this product range will therefore be the Pecunio Gold Coin (PGC), which refers to exactly one gram of 
segregated, unallocated 999.9 fine gold from LBMA-approved refineries. There is no comparable asset out 
on the market at given time.

TOKENIZED FUNDS
Our tokenized funds invest into the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICOs and AC & VCs. Investing into ICOs 
and tokenized AC & VC leverages the performance of our funds compared to regular crypto investments by 
far. Our fund management avails of profound experience from the traditional- , as well as from the hedge 
fund industry.

A CRYPTOCURRENCY CARD 
Our crypto debit card allows coin and token spending in fiat currencies around the world. The prepaid debit 
card spares local exchange fees and makes digital currency spending a whole lot easier. Pecunio enables 
cryptocurrency spending with instant liquidity.

AN ICO INCUBATOR, A BLOCKCHAIN START UP ANGELIST
Our expertise in traditional and hedgefund management qualifies us to accompany blockchain businesses 
successfully spreading their wings. We launch ICO campaigns with a dedicated fund, management support, 
legal advice and more. At the same time PECUNIO shares earned profits with its company token holders 
via a buyback program.

VISION

The idea of blockchain has opened a whole new chapter of value transfer. Which currencies will stay in 
place and proof themselves successful, at which price and on base of which business model or technology 
is yet unclear. What we do know for certain is that cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are definitely a part 
of the future. 
They have revolutionized payments, transactions and many other markets and will soon become 
established as the new standard.

Pecunio’s mission is to open the cryptocurrency market to everyone with a variety of interesting products 
and services. As a trustworthy company, we encourage blockchain adoption and offer a safe and easy way 
to take part in the future of financial markets. 

We personally believe in the philosophical mission of Satoshi Nakamoto and created a safe and transparent 
investment solution with easy access for everyone.

WE PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MISSION OF  
SATOSHI NAKAMOTO AND CREATED A SAFE AND TRANSPARENT  

INVESTMENT SOLUTION WITH EASY ACCESS FOR EVERYONE.

Your Share of the Future.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

Since the introduction of blockchain technology, there has been a high demand for crypto assets 
on the markets with likeliness of further increase. Fintech is a completely new sector in finance 
without any institutions yet and financial service providers have not been able to meet rising 
demands for Bitcoin and/or blockchain investment solutions. Finance & Investments are still 
heavily underrepresented as a category, due to a lack of innovation and decentralization. It is just 
as of recent, that CBOE and CME group launched Bitcoin futures markets.

The dawn of a new investment era began starting with the incredibly successful Ethereum ICO in 
July 2014. Imagine having invested an amount of two thousand dollars in ETH at that time. Right 
now in 2017, in less than three years, those two thousand dollars would have achieved an amount 
worth more than 1 million US $ by now. The same applies for blockchain solution “Stratis”:  
Only 12 month after its ICO, tokenholders have multiplied their initial investment by factor 600. 

In 2017 the cryptocurrency market capitalisation went from  
$ 16BN to $ 770BN US. The trend here is clear and cannot  
be disregarded.

UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION

• We provide transparency in a complex market 

• We are constantly adapting and refining our sustainable business model 

• We offer a functioning set of working products

• We provide highest safety standards through cold storage 

• We offer all transactions via one platform 

• We offer a scalable low cost platform solution 

• We combine constant advancement with a lean cost structure 

• We can rely on a strong community of more than 50.000 enthusiasts

Nevertheless, there are a load of obstacles to be challenged before adapting cryptocurrency usage 
on a broad scale. It is hard for non-tech-savvy users to easily enter the crypto markets. There are 
no institutional guidelines or trustworthy partners to rely on. And of course as the cryptocurrency 
market is a very young and new sector in finance, it comes with rather high volatility.



9

Pecunio is a public gateway to the cryptomarket: It is a decentralized investment platform 
simplifying blockchain investments, backed by a transparent and trustworthy company.

Our platform is a one-stop-shop and solves the problem of crypto spending with one simple 
dashboard. It allows converting from and to cryptocurrencies as well as  investing into 
valuable assets like the commodity-backed gold token or PECUNIO‘s blue-chip crypto fund (PCC)

Besides that, Pecunio is the only blockchain investment platform with a free exchange and a 
cryptocurrency card. Another strong pillar of Pecunio´s unique position in the market: Our users gain 
customer lifetime value as we are not a product centric seller or exchange, but a care taker with 
active management and active customer support.

SIGN UP

Sign up is as easy as creating a Facebook Account.

The user signs up to create an account on PECUNIO’s platform by providing an email address, a 
user name and a password. Upon confirmation via email, a personal wallet is created and he is 
automatically directed to the user dashboard where he finds an overview of his personal account and 
holdings.

After successfully transferring cryptocurrencies into his account, it is now the user’s choice whether 
to spend it via the crypto card, exchange it or invest it into PECUNIO’s products.

Every platform user has the opportunity to purchase into different types of products: The asset-
backed token (PGC), various fund tokens (PCC, PICO, PAV), as well as the PECUNIO utility token 
(PCO). All platform related products and services can only be accessed with the PCO.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN

“We have elected to put our money 
and faith in a mathematical framework 
that is free of politics and human error.“ 

Tyler Winklevoss, Co-creator of Facebook, top investor in Bitcoin.

The Blockchain is a foundational technology like the Internet itself—a big system enabling 
applications to be built on it and value to be stored and transferred safely via a transparent public 
ledger. The idea of a decentralized, global payment network with low cost and settlement time has 
profound implications across the world-wide financial system. 

Abstracting away from solely the financial sector, the transparency and integrity of data on the 
Blockchain may transform broad industries and industry standards in areas like record keeping, 
logistics, law, identity management, securities settlement, application development and many 
more. Furthermore corporate formation & governance, asset representation, contract & agreement 
structuring, and the traditional thought processes associated with; each are rapidly being challenged, 
questioned, re-thought, re-approached, and re-structured because of the spark ignited by the concept 
of the blockchain. We now find ourselves at the forefront of a huge wave of innovation. Approximately 
80% of banks are developing their own blockchain technology today. This is one of the main reasons 
the world’s biggest firms are now investing into this promising technology and/or adopting it as well. 

The real value of the blockchain is that it renders intermediaries completely obsolete. Middlemen 
acting as third party establishing “trust” between unknown parties are no longer inevitable. The 
blockchain basically replaces these middlemen.

A series of industries will become seriously disrupted, first and foremost:

WHY BLOCKCHAIN WHY FUND MANAGEMENT



12

Financial Services (Banks, Clearing houses, Money Transfer)
Banks are essentially secure storehouses and transfer hubs for money. Blockchain’s secure, 
decentralized, and tamper-proof ledger addresses this function—at a fraction of the cost. A 
company called “Thought Machine” has already created a “blockchain bank.” Clearing houses 
and stockbrokers are also in the firing line for the same reason. Companies like Western Union 
and MoneyGram have always dominated money transfer services. But blockchain start-ups 
are trying to create a competitive scenario by offering faster, cheaper and versatile forms of 
money transfer.

Real Estate
When most people think of buying and selling property, they think of copious amounts of 
paperwork, long, administrative processes, and high agent fees. Using blockchain, anyone can 
manage, track, and transfer land titles and property deeds—no need for intermediaries. A 
company called Ubiquity is providing this service already.

Music Streaming
Music streaming is great—well, maybe not for the musicians. It’s estimated
that artists lose up to 86% of the proceeds of their music because of illegal
downloading. The blockchain makes it possible for artists to earn royalties on their
music without going through a record label.
Grammy Award Winner Imogen Heap has created a blockchain-based
streaming platform called MYCELIA that is, besides others, facilitating this issue.

 



13

WHY FUND MANAGEMENT
Despite Bitcoin’s impressive annualized returns since its inception in 2009, the reality is that 
blockchain technology is still in its infancy and no one knows whether it will become globally accepted. 
This uncertainty surrounding blockchain and Bitcoin’s future is reflected in the price volatility of 
cryptocurrencies. When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies and ICOs, there are a few risks 
investors need to be aware of and mitigate:

Regulatory Risk
Probably the biggest risk to the future success of Bitcoin, as both a currency and as an investment 
class, is regulatory risk. If China, for example, decides to ban its citizens from holding Bitcoin, the 
price of the digital currency would crash. China is by far the largest market for Bitcoin trading, with 
over 90 percent of trading occurring in the People’s Republic. Hence, any negative regulatory changes 
would have a direct impact on the world’s Bitcoin investments.
The same goes for leading Bitcoin start-up hubs like the U.S. and the U.K. Should any large economy 
ban Bitcoin, the price will collapse and struggle to recover.

ICO Scams
Many ICOs/token launches lack legitimacy for one of the following reasons:

1. Some ICOs are outright scams. Their founders simply cash in on the absurd amount of 
“dumb money” that people throw into token launches. (The “investors” can often be people 
who missed the boat on Bitcoin and/or Ether, who truly don’t understand the differences in 
between the various cryptocurrencies, particularly when it comes to value.)

2. Other ICOs are illegitimate because they are essentially a solution without a problem — 
not everything needs a decentralized application with its own currency. Because of these 
risks, a significant set of due diligence questionnaire has to be implied before buying into a 
potential ICO.

It is asked too much, for an average individual with a day job to occupy oneself with all the details 
of a rapidly changing market. In order to react to these dynamic systems it needs experts and due 
diligence; both are pillars of our performance policy, which is the reason why we preferred active 
management of our funds in order to adapt to fluctuated markets. Additionally portfolio diversification 
mitigates market volatility, fraud and operational risks while as being a hedge fund renders us 
profitable even during falling markets.

ASSET BACKED TOKENS

Gold has always been the perfect hedge against volatility. Blockchain technology with its high speed 
transfer of value, security and convenience of operation enables this next step in the future of finance: 
It allows us to reintroduce gold in digital form as a global currency on the blockchain. Each Pecunio 
Gold Coin represents exactly 1 gram of segregated, unallocated 999.9 fine gold from LBMA-approved 
refineries. We will be the first FinTech company to exchange physical gold for tokens worldwide.

Pecunio and its partners will store physical gold with the intent, that its gold reserves constantly 
meet or exceed the amount of PGC in circulation. We do not deliver a promise; we deliver gold via a 
cryptocurrency. 

IT IS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AND SAFEST WAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET. 

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The Pecunio Gold Coin is:

•   999.9 fine gold in tokenized form (PGC)

•   The world’s best hedge against volatility as a token

•   A payment option for goods and services  
     (gold backed cryptocurrency)

•   The easiest way to handle and export physical gold 
     (world wide branches for direct pick up)

•   The safest and most transparent way of transacting gold

FREE EXCHANGE
We accept and exchange all major cryptocurrencies, whereas we do not charge any fees on behalf of 
exchanging currencies on our platform. The Exchange will be directly connected to the user wallets 
and therefore only charges fees (incl. regular network fee) when cryptocurrencies are removed from 
the platform. Full functionality of the exchange will be implemented after the ICO.

CRYPTOCURRENCY CARD
Pecunio’s cryptocurrency card is a prepaid multi-asset debit card, enabling coin and token spending 
in all fiat currencies around the world without exchange fees. The user will be able to manage assets 
via the platform, charging the card with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Pecunio and many 
other cryptocurrencies.
The debit cards come with free choice of name on card and will be valid for 36 months. No matter 
where in the world you live, you can be a Pecunio cryptocurrency card holder and easily manage your 
assets via our user-friendly dashboard.

TOKENIZED FUNDS
Our fund management avails of profound experience from the traditional- , as well as from the hedge 
fund industry. Yielding a good return is our aim as we work on making sizeable commissions and 
crypto earnings going forward. By choosing a tokenized investment vehicle, we bring liquidity to the 
angel- and venture capital market, which is otherwise a highly illiquid environment. Token holders 
can sell and exchange at any given time, making that alone the most significant innovation in AC & 
VC markets over recent decades. 

Investors will benefit from managerial expertise, broad diversification, careful pre-selection and 
reallocation of included coins and tokens and ongoing risk management.

FUND DETAILS

1. PECUNIO Cryptocurrency Fund (PCC)
PECUNIO Cryptocurrency Fund is a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrency 
coins and tokens. PCC is restricted to blockchain assets, which are 
already exchange traded (eg. 1st Bitcoin, 2nd generation altcoins 
like Ether, Ripple, Litecoin and 3rd generation asset tokens like EOS, 
Tether and Gnosis). The fund is managed and (re-)allocated based on 
managerial discretion, however framed by a determined set of rules.  

PCC represents our first product, and was successfully launched 
on the well-known ICONOMI platform on 4th of October 2017. The 
diversified and risk-adjusted portfolio has a proven track record with 
an exceeding performance and can be found not only on our platform:

https://www.iconomi.net/dashboard/#/daa/PCC
 

2. PECUNIO Initial Coin Offering Fund (PICO)
PECUNIO ICO Fund targets blockchain companies in their pre-ICO 
and ICO phase. PICO Fund is restricted to blockchain assets, which 
have a minimum viable product, and are in the preparation for an ICO 
event. Our management team will apply extensive due diligence, to 
filter weak market propositions, mediocre teams and potential scams 
from the long list. From the short list on, we work closely together 
with our target investments, helping them to conduct an optimal lCO 
launch. Investors in PICO will benefit from our industry links and our 
investigative strengths to uncover potential fraud schemes.

A simple comparison:
Ø BTC price (Bitfinex) October 4th 2017: $ 4309.60 US, 
January 10th 2018: $ 14435.00 US = 334.99% increase

Ø ETH price (Bitfinex) October 4th 2017: $ 291.40 US, 
January 10th 2018: $ 1284.00 US = 428.28%increase

Ø PCC on October 4th 2017: $ 100 US, 
January 10th 2018: $ 433.15 US = 433.15% increase

PECUNIO’s Cryptocurrency fund clearly has the makings  
to outperform current market developments. 



19

3. PECUNIO Angel & Venture Fund (PAV)
In addition to the broader market offerings, PECUNIO will launch a 
fund, dedicated to angel & venture investments in the blockchain 
space. This dedicated fund aims at exceptionally high performance – 
targeting a multiplication of capital. PECUNIO’s expert team, supported 
by selected external industry advisors, will actively manage PAV. Our 
experts will continually scout for early investment opportunities in the 
blockchain start-up scene.
Through this handpicked fund offering, everyone can be an angel & 
venture capital investor, without any entry or capital requirements. In 
order to avoid capital dilution and oversubscription, the fund offering 
will be exclusive by invitation only. PECUNIO ICO investors will be 
invited to join the PECUNIO Angel & Venture Fund.

Risk Management
Investing into ICOs and tokenized AC & VC leverages the performance of our funds compared to 
regular cryptocurrency investments by far. Typically, higher return means higher risk (of loss). 
We approach to lower the overall risk by carefully diversifying our fund’s assets, maintaining high 
performance attributes. Selected due diligence parameters and a planned set of steps according to 
our risk analysis are the frameworks for our success in risk management. Nevertheless,  it has to be 
stated, that a total loss of capital is not inevitable.

(For those interested in a deeper understanding of asset risk management, we recommend reading 
Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools by Alexander J. McNeil, Rüdiger Frey 
and Paul Embrechts, published by Princeton University Press in 2015; revised 2nd edition, 1st edition 
2005)



20

Selected start ups will receive management support, legal advice and financial aid to help spread 
(spreading) their wings as they get ready for /to take off. It is our business venture to spot, target and 
support potential top performers in this hyper-dynamic market. We help in developing their business 
ideas/ proposition and product portfolio. We support our clients using our analytical and social media 
marketing tools, and also by establishing communities and connecting with the press and the media. 
Delicately our clients are guided through crucial steps to circumvent unnecessary future red tape 
barriers which often impede on any positive achievement. 
Our goal is to increase the success rate of highly potential ideas and future market leading 
developments.

PLATFORM / EXCHANGE / WALLET / MOBILE APP
The platform with its user-friendly dashboard enables quick access to a variety of features. On one 
hand, there is a wallet displaying the account balance, a cryptocurrency exchange and the opportunity 
to invest into PECUNIO‘s tokenized funds and products. On the other hand there is a referral system, 
allowing the user to profit from his own ambition and satisfaction using peer-to-peer networking. 
Our easy-to-use platform will be available via web-interface and via wallets on both Android and 
iOS according to our roadmap timeline. Our Mobile Apps will use cutting edge native frameworks to 
provide a fast and natural user experience.

ICO INCUBATOR, A BLOCKCHAIN ANGELIST



21

To fund the project and the platform, we conduct a token sale. (ICO/ITO) The ticker symbol for our 
company token will be PCO. Token sale proceeds as follows.

HARD FACTS

Our crowdsale will be performed in two stages: 

• Pre-ICO: February 1st – 21st 2018
• ICO: March 19th - April 19th 2018 

Bonus stages:
• February 1st – 21st 2018: 25% BONUS
• March 19th - April 19th 2018: 0% BONUS 

Available in ICO: 30,000,000 PCO 
Full supply: 100,000,000 PCO
Hard Cap:  $ 45,000,000 US
Accepted currencies: BTC, ETH, LTC
Exchange Rate: 1 PCO = $ 1.5 US 

Token Utility Function: PCOs are primarily a means of payment, „a digital coupon“, for all the 
services PECUNIO provides, especially ICO Services and Platform related fees. No other means of 
payment will be accepted. PCO allows buying of funds and native tokens on platform and acts as 
value transfer.

No Expectation of Profits: Due to the utility nature of the PCO tokens , it does not provide 
dividends, profit shares or voting rights to its holders. No guarantees or assurances are provided, 
the PCO token shall not be considered an investment.

Architecture: PCO Tokens are Ethereum ERC-20 tokens

Acceptence of Tokens: PCO Tokens are accepted on the PECUNIO platform solely for the time 
being. Since the tokens will be released after the Token Generation Event, secondary market 
trading is possible. Token buyers have to be aware that due the utility nature of the token a rise in 
value is possible however unlikely. Thus PCO tokens shall not be regarded as an investment. 

NO MORE PCO WILL BE CREATED AFTER THIS TGE EVENT.

TOKEN SALE PROCEDURE



22

Allocation of tokens
• 20.000.000 of PCO created during the creation event will be allocated to PECUNIO founders

• 20.000.000 PCO will be allocated to financial backers and early stage supporters

• 10.000.000 of PCO created during the creation event will be allocated to the company 
and utilized as a future employee and management token pool, to strengthen our ability to 
attract & retail top talent and contractual bonusses; these tokens will be locked for 12 
months and are subject to a leak-out clause

• 5.000.000 of PCO created during the creation event will be created for and granted to 
advisors and bounty supporters; these tokens will be locked for 3 months and are subject 
to a leak-out clause

Capital Reserve
• 15.000.000 of PCO will be credited to the reserve, but not issued. These PCO´s will 

be available as an additional source of funding, but may never be issued, depending on 
circumstances in the future.

TOKEN VALUE 
PECUNIO’s PCO token is a utility token. It acts as a means of payment, a „digital coupon“, for all 
the services PECUNIO provides, especially ICO Services and Platform related fees. PCO allows the 
purchase of fund tokens and native tokens on platform. The tokens shall not be confused with  
company shares, which they are not. They are digital goods, bearing no intrinsic value by themselves, 
but the value of the assets, services and/or rights which can be purchased by these tokens. 



23

The asset tokens will be represented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Coding and 
customizing work will be done in Solidity, a high level programming language similar to JavaScript, 
targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the runtime environment for smart 
contracts in Ethereum.

Pecunio is an ERC-20 TOKEN

• Security and predictability (as opposed to having to run an independent blockchain network);
• Use of robust and well- supported clients (Ethereum based tokens can be managed with 

official Ethereum clients):
• High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum based tokens or Ether);
• Easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place;
• Ethereum smart contracts enable a transparent and secure way of value transfer. 

Exchange
The exchange works via a matching engine through asset proxies. The interface is therefore linked 
to external exchanges and addresses via the asset proxy smart contract, which complies with 
ERC-20 standards. This makes the exchange manipulation-safe and enables true transparency. 

The software will be written in a hardware-friendly programming language to maintain speed for 
fast transactions. As for now, for safety reasons, we decided to keep development in a closed 
environment - with consideration of future decentralization.

Wallets 
PECUNIO’s multi-wallets will accept multiple currencies and will be written in JavaScript, among 
other Bitcore framework. Furthermore, there will be dedicated apps for iOS and Android which 
assure the same functionality as the web interface. Mobile Apps will use cutting edge native 
frameworks to provide a fast and natural user experience.

ROADMAP

Here are some of our recent progressions towards full functionality of our  
platform, contract development and roll out of our campaigns. 

The future is bright and there is more to come, so please take a look on 
how we aim to achieve what we state.

• Created the platform with working accounts

OUR TEAM AND OUR VALUES

WE ACT WITH INTEGRITY AND SHOW RESPECT
We demonstrate a commitment to integrity and ethics. Show respect for and value all individuals 
for their diverse backgrounds, experiences, styles, approaches and ideas. Our brand is built on 
principles of trust and honesty. 

WE VALUE CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 
We strive to make our products simple to understand and easy to use. We take extra care to think 
and communicate with absolute clarity, be it with our customers, our partners or internally. No fine 
print, clear words, clear actions.

WE DON’T FOLLOW WE LEAD
We push the envelope in blockchain investment products, doing things that have never been done 
before, in order to win the hearts and minds of our customers.
The blockchain revolution presents tremendous opportunities for the fast and the smart (see

We are the prime mover in our field. As former securities and commercial lawyers, hedgefund

investment platform: PECUNIO.

We achieve results and celebrate when we do. We help people to be their best by providing 
coaching and feedback. We make people feel valued and appreciated. We communicate open and

THE BUSINESS CASE

 
MAIN INCOME SOURCE: 
We project the management fee to be 4%, the performance fee to be set at between 15% and 
30%. This fee is perfectly on par with alternative investment manager’s industry standards. 

• Fee: 4% of all assets under active management 
• Estimated assets under management (2018): 500 Million US$ 
• Estimated revenue from asset management (2018): 20 Million US$

Gold-token-associated transaction and storage fee:
We are currently observing the markets in order to assure a competitive pricing for transaction of 
tokens and demurrage of physical gold. This will be a major income source due to the possible use of 
the token as a B2B payment token.

SECONDARY INCOME SOURCE:

Card fee:
• Fee: 4% of all assets under active management  

Transaction fee:
• Fee 1% of all transactions: approx. $ 600.000 US p.a.

PECUNIO intends to add additional recurring revenue streams within the next 12-18 months, 
including transaction and consultancy fees.

Revenues from ICO fees
ICO fees are calculated as a 25% cut of the ICO transaction volume, taken on average. We have 
also taken into account currency and token market growth.

In order to maintain a stable and growing product and service platform to provide purchasing power 
for the PCO tokens, PECUNIO needs revenues. PECUNIO’s revenues come from different sources:

OUR PRIME REVENUE STREAMS

ADDITIONAL REVENUES



30

Partnerships
Additionally, we will partner with innovative FinTech companies around the globe to provide our 
customers with the best digital investment. 
We intend to be a leading digital investment platform and generate revenues with selected “best in 
class” partners in other financial categories (VC, hedge funds, savings, credit & loans, insurance) 
with an emphasis on blockchain empowered partners. 
Strategic partnerships with investment funds, private banks and insurance companies will follow. 
On top of that, we are proud to be chosen as one of the 12 DAA managers of Iconomi.

Live Events
We plan on hosting different live events in various venues with regard to our core markets. These 
events include: 

• Investor Days: Attracting potential investors at distinguished events with our products 
and services will add new opportunities and new relationships to PECUNIO. 

• Road shows: With the purpose of strengthening brand awareness and brand value we will 
chose different locations with the goal of increasing PECUNIO’s reach in public. 

• Live speeches: It is hard to compare what could be more convincing than, a good speech 
backed by a great product. Public events are a great way to communicate to a broad 
audience. 

• Blockchain events: We will not miss out our chance to be represented at blockchain 
meet-ups all over the world in order to educate on our solutions in the world of blockchain. 

• Financial events: We are in finance. In order to attract customers and clients from 
the old economy and open the gates to new possibilities it is of importance to connect, 
collaborate and co-operate. 

Global Marketing: 
Multi Channel marketing campaigns to be organized, designed and implemented by a team of senior 
professionals include 

• ONLINE marketing
• DIRECT marketing
• SOCIAL marketing
• PR reach increase

AuM growth rate assumptions
We will grow the overall Assets under Management (AuM) progressively over the next 5 years, with 
a growth rate starting from 70% (year 2019), decelerating to 40% (year 2022). We expect the 
AuMs to be between 135 Mio US $ and 320 Mio US $, for our three scenarios. This would put us at 
par with a typical mid-sized hedge fund. Growing to about 1 Bn US $ at the end of the 5 year period, 
we would match the size criterion for a large-size hedge fund.

Market growth rates
Since the beginning of 2017, the Token market has grown at a value-weighted average of about 300 % 
annualized. The market will continue to grow, however at a more moderate pace. 

We have therefore taken a range of growth rates from 50% to 80% per year as our yardstick. For each of 
our three scenarios, it is expected that the Blockchain economy grows by around 3% (Conservative), 5% 
(Realistic) and 7% (Optimistic) – per month for the next 5 years. 

This equates to around a 40% and 80% annual growth in total assets, fueling PCO fee inflows.

The ICO fees will be set at 25%, on average.

AuM Growth Rates (2018 to 2022) and ICO fees

Below are the more detailed projections of revenue dynamics under the three different scenarios 
over a 5-year period.

Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022

Fund growth rates @ n/a 70% 60% 50% 40%

ICO fees @ 25% 25% 25% 25% 25%

SCENARIOS

PECUNIO‘s innovative business model is profound and elaborate. It is impossible to evaluate 
prospects and future financial results with absolute precision, which is why we offer three possible 
scenarios to help understand different levers and possible out-comes for our project:



32

Conservative Scenario
In the conservative scenario, we modestly grow our asset base and revenue streams. We will 
operate in a highly competitive market space. However, we strengthen our position as the world’s 
first fully decentralized investment platform by adding new fund features valued by the investment 
community. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 135 Mio US $, by the end of 2018.

In the conservative scenario, we forecast only a modest increase of market and fund growth rates. The 
total fee revenues for the 5-year period are expected to be around 510 Mio US $

Realistic Scenario

In the realistic scenario, we grow our asset base and revenue streams more dynamically. 
We will operate in a competitive, but expanding market space. We strengthen our position as the world’s 
first fully decentralized investment platform by adding new fund feature, growing the client base and 
capitalizing on market gains. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 215 Mio US $, by the end of 
2018.

In the realistic scenario, we forecast a progressive increase of market and fund growth rates. The total 
fee revenues for the 5-year period are expected to be around 733 Mio US $.

OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO

In the optimistic scenario, we grow our asset base and revenue streams still more dynamically. We 
will operate in a competitive, though more or less unrestricted growth market. The growth rates will 
resemble the dot.com market of the late 1990ies. We strengthen our position as the world’s first and 
leading fully decentralized investment platform by progressively growing the client base and capitalizing 
on significant market gains. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 320 Mio US $, by the end of 
2018.

In the optimistic scenario, we forecast a progressive increase of market and fund growth rates. The total 
fee revenues for the 5-year period are expected to be around 1.046 Mio US $.
