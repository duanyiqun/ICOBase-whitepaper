Abstract

We are consuming more content than ever; 3.6 billion people read the news, listen
to music or podcasts and watch videos and movies online every day.

Supply and demand of content is constantly growing, however the fundamental
dynamics of the media industry are sub-optimal and a paradigm shift is required.

Writers, musicians, movie-makers and producers should be able to �nd and re-
ward each other without the need for an intermediary (i.e. a media company),
other than the platform upon which an article or video is published.

Hubii Network is a blockchain-based decentralised content marketplace that fa-
cilitates transactions between creators, distributors and consumers by leveraging
the power of smart contracts1. Kickstarting this marketplace is Hubii’s existing
distribution network reaching out to over 50 million people.

By replacing the middlemen with an e�cient infrastructure, content creators earn
more, distributors pay less and consumers have more choices. Smart contracts and
‘smart crowdfunding’, all using our native cryptocurrency, Hubiits, will shape the
content industry of the future.

1 Preface
Hubii is a Norwegian startup with headquarters in Bergen and subsidiaries in the
USA and Singapore. We have received international recognition2, 3 as a location-based
news aggregator and established global partnerships with leading companies across
the world4, 5.

Hubii has been working between content creators and distributors (telecom opera-
tors, OEMs, and app developers), facilitating the development of their own products
using Hubii’s engine.

This has allowed Hubii to build a distribution network reaching out to 50m users every
day. We have 560 publishers and syndication partners around the globe.

Hubii’s team has been interacting with blockchains since mid-2011, but now we have
the right business model and technology to aggressively deliver our ambitions.

This year, Hubii’s team committed to building a blockchain-based decentralised con-
tent marketplace (speci�cally Ethereum-based), extending our content o�ering from
text to include still images, audio and video.

2 Introduction
The number of internet users will exceed 3.8Bn in 20186 and is forecast to grow at a
steady 10% per year7. This growth is mirrored in the amount of time spent online per
user, which is growing by 5 to 6%.8

While the growing market means ever greater demand and reach for content, it is
becoming all the more di�cult for content creators to maintain control over their cre-
ative works and keep a fair share of the revenue generated. Another topical challenge
is the concept of ‘fake news’ and the need to determine the provenance of content. The
whole media industry is broken and blockchain technology will help us to �x it.

By 2020 the media industry as a whole will pick up to over $2 trillion9 and it is Hubii’s
�rm belief that the ine�ciencies in the market and industry can be solved through the
use of blockchain technology and the application of smart contracts.

Hubii’s mission is to create a new leading Ethereum-based decentralised content mar-
ketplace where creators and rightsholders can meet distribution networks and reach
content buyers directly, all while having total con�dence in maintaining the integrity
of their rights through the use of smart contracts.

Only a proven media partner with existing relationships can do the job - and thus
building on our knowledge and connections of the past �ve years, we introduce Hubii
Network.

3 Current Status of the Industry
The current status of the content industry can be analysed from many di�erent angles.
Here we shed more light on this.

3.1 Players and Their Pain Points
The three main actors in the value chain, creators, distributors and consumers, su�er
from di�erent pain points.

3.1.1 Content Creators

Content creators face the following issues :
• They often do not get su�ciently rewarded for their work and their compensa-

tion is not related to the revenue generated.

• They lose control of their works once their content is published.

• Separate engagements with multiple distributors add complexity to their sale
process.

• There is a lack of data driven tools giving them insights into the consumer’s
interactions with their content.

3.1.2 Emerging Content Distributors

Emerging content distributors such as phone manufacturers, telecom operators and
app developers, are embedding themselves as trusted content providers o�ering ser-
vices to their users. This strategy is allowing them to leverage their large user base
and o�er value-added services engaging the users for longer periods of time and con-
sequently monetising them.

They are, however, su�ering the following pain points :
• They have to pay hefty fees to a variety of middlemen to get hold of content.

This means they operate on small margins and this often pushes them to acquire
lower quality content.

• As emerging distributors, they do not have strong or well-formed content strate-
gies.

• Their content is usually second-hand or non-premium.

• They require a combination of international and local content due to their user
base.

5



3.1.3 Content Consumers

Content consumers su�er from the following problems :

• Users are hit with a constant wave of content where is it di�cult to separate
signal from noise.

• They have to use multiple platforms to get hold of di�erent types of content.

• The content quality is below the desired standard.

• They are exposed to hundreds of ads a day.

3.2 New Trends
The developing world is rapidly growing and is thirsty for content; Thailand with 68
million inhabitants, Philippines with 100 million, Myanmar with 54 million, Malaysia
with 10 million and Indonesia with 260 million inhabitants are examples of large mar-
kets that are coming online which will not follow the technology adoption path of most
western countries. Furthermore, they are reshaping how content consumption takes
place. Hubii’s existing relationships in the developing world are extensive, giving us
insight and a platform ripe for leverage.

From a content point of view, we are seeing an explosion in the numbers of content-
creating smartphone apps entering the market, across a range of areas such as enter-
tainment, education, communication and utility. Within 5 years, 80% of the adult world
will have an smartphone.10

New business models have been opened up by the internet, and we have seen a surge
in the number of value-added apps and services for smartphones and web.

As a result, these new players have the opportunity to amplify the content reach and
o�er services across a range of basic handsets, e�ectively catering to the needs of all
their subscribers. Brands need to develop content which is device-agnostic, thereby
maximising the number of customers being targeted. This approach is particularly
e�ective when combined with localised content, tailored speci�cally to particular ge-
ographic regions or sets of users.

There is a need and space for a player that is willing to ease the existing pain points
hereby presented, building the solution around content creators and rightholders; em-
powering journalists, musicians and movie makers with the ability to reach out to
millions of users in a frictionless manner and monetise their works.

4 Hubii Network
Hubii Network is an Ethereum-based decentralised content marketplace where the
production, distribution and consumption of content is re-shaped by leveraging the
mechanisms that Ethereum o�ers.

Hubii Network shall apply a market structure by nurturing and managing perfect com-
petition11 to thrive. In other words, a market should be free of monopoly and controlled
by individual participants.

The trustless nature of cryptocurrency will allow all parties to make an exchange with-
out the oversight or intermediation of a third party. This will reduce or even eliminate
counterparty risk.

The objective is to establish a healthy ecosystem whereby creators can de�ne their
rules of engagement, distributors get access to a constant pool of content and con-
sumers ultimately get hold of the content they desire.

Making use of smart contracts and smart properties will allow Hubii Network to �x
the pain points in the industry and, furthermore, apply mechanisms never seen before
in the market. All this will be delivered whilst having full transparency, accountability
and security over the transactions using our own cryptocurrency, Hubiits12 (HUBs).

The long term goal is for the entire Hubii Network to be open source and decentralised
in nature.

4.1 Two Sided Marketplace Dynamics
We will utilise cross-side network e�ects in our marketplace. The value for a content
creator joining Hubii Network is a function of the number of distributors and con-
sumers that are present. Similarly, for distributors and consumers, the value is related
to the number of content creators publishing their work within Hubii Network. Hubii
has proven experience building this type of market already.

Demand liquidity is the single biggest challenge in any cross-side network e�ect plat-
form, creating a chicken & egg problem; a band would not be willing to distribute their
songs through the platform if there are not enough distributors/consumers in it. In our

11Where : (1) all �rms sell an identical product, (2) all �rms are price takers, (3) all �rms have rela-
tively small market share, (4) buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the
prices charged by each �rm and (5) the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit.

case that issue is already solved thanks to our existing distribution pipeline.

We already have a large set of distribution partners, reaching out to over 50 mil-
lion daily users, currently supplying content from Hubii. We believe this strength,
together with the introduction of Hubiits and heavy use of smart contracts to secure
the monetary transactions and IP rights, will act as an incentive to attract content pro-
ducers.

Furthermore, we have the possibility to enable distribution partnerships that could
reach out to over 800 million people daily. Therefore, as the supply of content in-
creases the marketplace could amplify its reach extremely rapidly.

The go-to-market strategy will require the motivation of both creators and distrib-
utors, using di�erent approaches. We will expand our distribution network, signing
exclusive deals with distributors in speci�c regions for a period of time in return for
a minimum investment commitment. The distributor must purchase content from the
Hubii Network and promote us within that region.

The Hubii Network will leverage the existing Hubii business. This product has helped
connect content creators and distributors already. The aim is always to maximise rev-
enue and enhance content consumption

To accelerate wide adoption and integration of Hubii Network we will foster openness
of our platform by providing RESTful API’s to the community of developers. Equally
we will integrate with the best suppliers of various di�erent decentralised technologies
such as e-wallets and decentralised storage solutions; We do not see value in reinvent-
ing the wheel; we want to begin to change the world at the platform level �rst.

4.2 Business Model Guiding Principles
Hubii Network will replace a number of middleman in this industry and charge a small
commission to the distributors. We intend for this to be a high volume, low margin
market, which will make the content industry as a whole much more e�cient. Distrib-
utors and ultimately customers will pay less for content, yet on the �ip side content
makers will get paid more.

Hubii will also have the potential to generate revenue through provision of liquid-
ity for eliminating exchange rate risk as discussed later.

Within our existing portfolio of distribution partners we encounter a small number of
them who mainly want low-quality and commodity content and have a policy of not

8



paying for content acquisition. In these cases we might apply server-side ad stitching
and DAI13 to monetise the content as it is being distributed.

4.3 Digital Rights Management
Any marketplace will only be successful if all sides can trust each other; the buyer has
to know content rights are veri�ed and the creator that content will not be pirated or
redistributed without consent.

In order to protect the rights DRM14 can be applied, when necessary, to relevant audio
and video content. Thus, distribution endpoints can only be connected to by validated
clients. Various patented DRM schemes are available to Hubii Network through our
partners, which support this level of security and trust. An essential feature of the
technology is that it can query the state of the content; veri�ed or disputed. In other
words, disputed content can be blocked at any point in the value chain.

Hubii Network’s content storage, distribution, encryption and acquisition processes
will be MPAA15 certi�ed and server-side monetisation will be based on various exist-
ing DRM schemes.

As every device in the chain would be a validated client, consumption patterns and
related transactions can be tracked and fed back to the content creators.

This data can be of high value to the creator and therefore be added to the contract as
requirement. Since everything in the distribution chain is based on encryption a high
degree of trust can be accomplished. In order to address potential privacy issues each
party seller, buyer, advertiser can anonymise it’s data while maintaining transaction
integrity.

DRM will not be applied to all content. DRM can be expensive and not always useful.
Vlogs and podcasts, for example, have little need for DRM and it could even harm their
distribution.

5 Use Cases
With the intention to provide tangible examples on how Hubii Network will re-shape
content production, distribution and consumption we have included a set of use cases.

Please note that the intention is to describe, from a high level perspective, how the
main work�ow of the Use Case would take place and the use of smart properties and
smart contracts a�ect it.

5.1 Content Production
This Use Case is applicable to Text, Audio and Video. For the purpose of this example
we will apply it to Audio.

Alice, a content creator, decides to publish her latest Podcast within Hubii Network.
At that time Alice establishes the smart contract for the Podcast indicating when the
Podcast is played ’X’ number of times she will get paid ’Y’ Hubiits.

Bob, upon accepting the rules indicated within the smart contract, decides to distribute
the Podcast through his network. Thus, as the Podcast is being played, when it reaches
’X’ number of plays, ’Y’ Hubiits will be paid to Alice.

Note that the content creator can track rights and usage data in real time on a global
scale each time a �le is accessed, and get paid instantly based on the rules she has
established within the smart contract. This will require the use of oracles16 to get real
world data into the smart contracts.

5.2 Amplifying Content Reach
This Use Case is applicable to Text, Audio and Video. For the purpose of this example
we will apply it to Text.

A journalist, Alice, decides to publish a high quality article within Hubii Network.
While de�ning the smart contract, Alice establishes that they will share ’X’ percentage
of the earnings for every ’Y’ reads produced by in�uencers distributing her article through
their social channels.

A social in�uencer, Bob, upon accepting the smart contract conditions, redistributes
the news article through his thousands of followers in di�erent social media channels.

16An Oracle is a third party service which can be used to get real-world data into smart contracts

10



Once the article shared through the social media channels is read ’Y’ number of times,
’X’ percent of the earnings will be automatically paid to Bob. Again, this will require
use of oracles.

It is important to note that in both examples the monetary transaction is based on
rules that are decided by the content creator and stored within the blockchain, are
transparent to both parties and do not require a mediator.

It is possible for the Hubii Network to take a contract arbitration role if there is a
requirement. Assume a smart contract where a creator could request a payment from
a distributors (locked up) funds for every 1,000 impressions; using a 2-of-3 multisig
model could allow Hubii to step in as a neutral observer to process or cancel that
transaction if a creator and distributor were to disagree or if there was a question over
oracle data. This would entail a slightly higher commission for Hubii Network.

5.3 Fake News Detection
This Use Case is applicable to Text, Audio and Video. For the purpose of this example
we will apply it to Text.

A journalist, Alice, publishes an article within Hubii Network and would like the facts
to be veri�ed by the community to minimise the risk of being labelled ’Fake News’.

Thus, at publishing time, Alice requests veri�cation of a set of facts within the arti-
cle. This veri�cation is crowdsourced from within the community. According to the
rules of the smart contract, ’X’ percent of the earnings of the article will be shared among
the veri�ers.

5.4 Tipping
This Use Case is applicable to Text, Audio and Video. For the purpose of this example
we will apply it to Music.

A consumer, Alice, while listening to a song from her favorite band, Bob and the Do-
ges17, decides that she would like to tip the band for their work. Alice can directly tip
’X’ number of Hubiits to the band for that song. This could be enabled within the Hubii
Network or a distributor platform.

17A popular band comprising of Shiba Inus

11



5.5 Smart Crowdfunding
This Use Case is applicable to Text, Audio and Video. In this case we will show two
examples; one for Music and one for Movie making.

ExampleA : A movie director, Alice, is seeking funding for her next Hollywood block-
buster. She decides to announce a Smart Crowdfunding in Hubii Network whereby
they are seeking ’X’ number of Hubiits in exchange for ’Y’ percent of the future earnings
which will be proportionally split among the ’Z’ backers of the movie. Furthermore, back-
ers of the project might have access to the premiere via Hubii Network.

Example B : Bob and the Doges, the band, are seeking funding for their next sum-
mer tour. They announce a Smart Crowdfunding in Hubii Network whereby would
like to raise ’X’ number of Hubiits in exchange for ’Y’ percent of the revenue obtained
through the tour (tickets and merchandising). Furthermore, backers of the project will
have a discount should they attend to the concert or will be able to virtually attend to
concert which will be streamed live via the Hubii Network.

6 Road Map
Hubii envisions 4 major releases through our roadmap across a period of 18 months
covering text, still images, audio and video.

The following roadmap describes a timeline which will be met given we raise a fairly
ambitious $40M through our token sale. If we do not raise this amount then the
roadmap will not change, but timing will be much more reliant on further traditional
investment. There will be no further token sales or token releases; if required, we shall
seek conventional venture capital.

We have determined that our scaling plans �t in with the general scaling plans of
the Ethereum network. In the worst case, clever use of payment channels will reduce
our load on the network and also reduce fees.

This roadmap comprises technical development together with business development
as we intend to keep on growing our distribution partnerships while the development
of the platform takes place.

Figure 2: Road Map

• R1; ETA, End Q4 2017 :

– A digital wallet will be implemented within the Hubii Network.
– Transparency dashboard; all parties involved in Hubii Network can see the

development of the main KPI’s a�ecting the performance of the business
and the Hubiits cryptocurrency.

– Creator and distributor dashboard for content ingestion, distribution and
con�guration of the smart contracts.

– SDK for distribution Partners.

13



– Textual content ingestion and distribution within the blockchain support-
ing a set of main smart contract use Cases.

– Deploy a pilot in South East Asia and Brazil for 1 month to, approximately
15M users. Upon successful pilot, we shall deploy world-wide.

• R2; ETA, End Q1 2018 :

– Release of market analytics tools; forecasting and audience matching sup-
ported by machine learning and image recognition algorithms.

– Integrate with VOD streaming platforms for ingestion and distribution and
run pilot tests.

– Integrate with music streaming services for ingestion and distribution - run
pilot tests.

– Image ingestion and distribution through the blockchain supporting smart
contract use cases.

– Smart Crowdfunding; Apply crowdfunding smart contracts for music/movie
artists and journalists where backers can obtain a return on their invest-
ment based on the smart contract rules.

– Smart contracts to manage exchange rate risk

• R3; ETA, End Q2 2018 :

– Audio ingestion and distribution within the blockchain; main smart con-
tract use cases are implemented.

– Deliver audio (music and podcasts) via distribution channels to music stream-
ing services.

– Paid crowdsourced content curation

• R4; ETA, End Q3 2018 :

– Video ingestion and distribution.
– Deliver video via distribution channels and VOD platforms.
– Server-side ad-stitching technology for video and audio
– Deliver AR, VR and e-sports content through distribution

• No �xed plans, dependent upon funding :

14



– Deprecation of our ERC20 token; All owners of ERC20 tokens would retain
the same fraction of the new replacement cryptocurrency. This might be
necessary to fully decentralise some unique features of the platform. How-
ever, it is also critical that this is not done before the mechanisms have been
fully optimised.

– Fog Computing; depending on the performance and latency obtained by
using the blockchain we will perform R&D to implement a Fog Computing
solution to improve system response time, minimise network and internet
latency and reduce amounts of data sent.

7 Feedback fromWithin the Industry
This is some of the feedback we have obtained from within the Industry;

“ The media industry is in turmoil, with traditional relationships be-tween creators and distributors broken and standard measures of valueunreliable. Blockchain, by disintermediating gatekeeper companies, can
rede�ne the industry for the 21st century, put control in the hands of mak-
ers and users, and allow a true marketplace to establish value. ”David Schlesinger, former Editor-in-Chief, Reuters
“At Telenor we aspire to be our customers’ favourite partner in digitallife. Through engaging products and services, such as WowBox, Telenor’slifestyle app, we deliver on this ambition and give people the full bene�t of
being connected. WowBox has reached more than 10 million users in our
Asian markets and Hubii has been an integral part of making it the suc-
cess that it is today, reaching out to our large user base with their global
content distribution network.

The team at Hubii has been important in creating value for our WowBox
customers by building solutions that make content distribution more ef-
fective and provide high value content. We wish them great success also
in the future.

It is our view that the team at Hubii really understands how to scale solu-
tions on a global level and make content distribution more e�ective. Their
help has been really valuable for Telenor and we wish them great success
also in the future. ”Bjørn Thorstensen, Telenor Group, Hubii’s business partner

8 Storage
Hubii’s current storage needs (text only) are 25GB per day. Still images add an extra
5Gb per day which are stored in a CDN18.

We foresee increasing data retention to much higher limits plus we shall add audio
and video �les. That would easily increase the data storage needs up to Petabytes
within a few months. This situation still does not take into consideration the stream-
ing capabilities required to serve audio and, specially, video �les to millions of users.

Fully decentralised storage systems are a work-in-progress, therefore conventional
storage methods are unavoidable. However, there is tantalising progress. We shall
establish early dialog with blockchain-based storage companies such as Storj, Sia, File-
coin, Burst and Maidsafe to present and discuss our data volume requirements at each
phase, for text, audio and video both from storage and streaming perspectives.

Our ultimate goal is to use a fully ‘on-chain’ solution, but considering the existing
limitations of these services, we have to be open minded and acknowledge we will
have to focus on providing an optimal service to our end users.

9 Removing Exchange Rate Risk
One potential obstacle to crypto-commerce is the volatility of tokens with respect to
user’s everyday currency (e.g. USD).19 If a user is happy to deposit and trade in Hu-
biits, then there is no issue. However, if they do not want to be exposed to exchange
rate risk then they might not be happy trading in Hubiits. On the Hubii Network this
problem will be minimised with hedging contracts.

If a customer deposits USD onto the platform and they want to keep their USD purchas-
ing power static then we will hedge their risk. In order to interact with the platform
and its smart contracts, users must use Hubiits. If they choose to interact in USD, then
we will use their USD to purchase Hubiits, but their interaction with the platform will
still be displayed and maintained in USD terms. They are e�ectively taking a long posi-
tion on Hubiits behind the scenes. In order for the user to not be exposed to the Hubiits
volatility, we will then hedge their position in the background, by opening a short on
their behalf. In this way, the user will no longer be impacted by price �uctuations. The
cost to service this system will depend upon the spread, trading fees and interest rate.
Hubii can also take a fee. However, we may in fact choose to subsidise the cost until
there is su�cient liquidity to make this extremely low cost. Token holders will lend
their tokens into a smart contract to fund this short position and receive an interest
rate as payment.

For complex contracts, if we �nd that users are reluctant to engage with the platform
and agree to ongoing contractual payments in Hubiits we will address this issue by in-
tegrating easily understood two-way, automated futures contracts. This will similarly
allow users to lock in prices in their chosen currency (e.g. USD) throughout the smart
contract duration. Token holders will be able to stake into this system and potentially
pro�t from price movements.

These contracts will be fully decentralised in nature, except for the necessary exchange
rate information. We will have solid liquidity partners acting as oracles for this pur-
pose.

Using these methodologies and without manual intervention, user’s balance and all
interactions can be denoted in USD. There is a fully transparent and visible (low) cost
to the user for this security.

Hubii will keep 5% of the total produced tokens to act as a liquidity pool for such
contracts. However, we will also allow individuals who hold tokens to stake into this

system and earn interest from users hedging and pro�t from futures trading. All of
this will be based on competitive market pricing.

10 Veri�cation ofContentRights inHubii SmartCon-
tracts

10.1 Protecting Intellectual Property
It is critical that we check that content uploaded by a user is actually their own intel-
lectual property. We will develop a framework here that will decentralise this content
veri�cation, however we must accept that, although our solution will be open-source,
it will be semi-decentralised at �rst. The transition to a truly decentralised system is
only possible once we deprecate our ERC20 tokens. This system will prove to be a
di�cult optimisation problem, which will take time to prove itself. When the equity of
the system has been demonstrated at scale we will switch to a more heavily customised
token, or perhaps our own blockchain if it is deemed necessary.

We will allow token holders to stake their tokens into smart contracts which allow
content to be �agged as either ‘Veri�ed’ or ‘Disputed’. These users will be our net-
work validators. ‘Veri�ed’ or ‘Disputed’ is a binary condition once achieved, but con-
tent begins life with neither designation. We will use a system to reward validators
for correctly verifying content, whilst simultaneously punishing an incorrect valida-
tion. This will allow the system to rapidly converge on one truth. Tokens staked into
the system by creators will build up a Reputation Weight as the creator submits more
‘Veri�ed’ content. This functionality is not included in an ERC20 token; we therefore
require a somewhat centralised solution at �rst.

We also must always ensure that tokens are fungible, in other words no token has
more value than any other. Therefore upon transfer, a token must shed its accrued
reputation.

The incentive for participating in the task of content validation is a small revenue
share to those users who successfully validate a piece of content. The revenue share
will be time-limited and potentially capped in value. This positive incentive is bal-
anced by the risk associated with staking tokens against an unsuccessful validation.
The justi�cation for this downside risk is easy to understand; if the system only ever
rewarded token holders for validating content and never punished them when they
were wrong, it would be rational for token holders to try and validate every piece of
content. As such, there must be a signi�cant penalty for wrongly identifying the con-
tent - namely, the loss of staked tokens. Our content validation system will therefore
converge rapidly towards truth, provided that the market for staking tokens is liquid
and the rewards and punishments su�ciently great. Any lost tokens will therefore be
split and distributed between correct validators, further incentivising participation in

20



the system. Similarly, this process might limit the required value of the revenue share,
potentially to the point whereby users will participate in content validation even when
no revenue sharing is o�ered.

10.2 Rapid Consensus
Each piece of content will rapidly reach consensus on validity as there is a race to be
among the veri�ers. Consequently, there is also a race to invalidate invalid content
and steal any falsely staked tokens. Until content is validated it cannot be o�ered to
distributors. After a consensus is determined to have been reached, content with ‘Dis-
puted’ status, is removed from the platform. This also occurs if the content is uploaded
to the platform, yet is not validated by anybody within a time period. At some point
all valid content will be classed as ‘Veri�ed’. When content is veri�ed, it must remain
veri�ed for a period of time in order for creators and validators to receive their revenue
share. Earned funds will essentially be locked up during this period. Having reached
and maintained ‘Veri�ed’ status for the required amount of time, another time limited
revenue share will then begin to be diverted into a ‘e-veri�cation bounty’ fund. It is
assumed at this point that those token holders who staked correctly were acting to
the best of their knowledge and as such, their tokens are returned to them safely. The
stakers will also now receive their revenue share. Any tokens staked incorrectly will
be seized and distributed proportionally amongst the correctly staked tokens.

Creators must stake a nominal quantity of tokens (or even a fraction of a token), in
order to build a reputation on their ‘pro�le’. Eventually they will be a ‘Veri�ed’ cre-
ator and the revenue share for validators from these users will decrease. A negative
veri�cation can damage their reputation and move them below the ‘Veri�ed’ threshold,
in which case the future revenue share for validators will increase again. However, it
will be expensive for other parties to falsely attack the reputation of a creator. This is
one reason we may later deprecate our ERC20 tokens for a new token which can carry
a ’reputational weight’. This would allow this system to also be fully decentralised.

10.3 De-verifying Content
Now let’s imagine a case where a content creator has submitted a video of a cat on a
skateboard and it was veri�ed for the required period of time. Let’s also assume later
that somebody else provides public and indisputable evidence that the cat video is in
fact their own content. There must exist a mechanism whereby content can become
de-veri�ed. We achieve this by restarting the process again once a piece of content has
been veri�ed, but with a couple of subtle di�erences. This time the content already
has a ‘Veri�ed’ status and there is also a ‘De-veri�cation Bounty’. A token holder who
believes the content should now be disputed, must have an incentive to stake their

21



tokens and this is access to a share of the ‘De-veri�cation Bounty’, if proven to be cor-
rect. Once users start to stake that the content is ‘Disputed’ then users who disagree
may wish to stake that the content is still ‘Veri�ed’, in an attempt to steal the tokens
from the new tokens staking for ‘Disputed’. If the new batch of stakers successfully
change the status of the content to ‘Disputed’, then the content is ‘Quarantined’ from
the platform and any contracts on it are paused. Content must remain in ‘Quarantined’
status for a period of time before the token holders who staked ‘Disputed’ will collect
the ‘De-veri�cation bounty’ and share the tokens that are now staked for ‘Veri�ed’, if
there are any. If the content never manages to reach ‘Quarantined’ status for a period
of time then the tokens staking for ‘Validated’ are rewarded with the ‘Disputed’ tokens.

Lastly, if content remains ‘Veri�ed’ for a long period of time then there will still be
a ‘De-veri�cation Bounty’ held in reserve. It is assumed at some point in the distant
future that the content is not going to be disputed any more and so eventually the
bounty is returned to the content creator.

10.4 ’Fake News’
As discussed in our use cases, we can also use this system for the veri�cation of news
and facts contained within content. This is a more challenging application to deliver as
people can have very di�erent opinions on ‘facts’, particularly where they are political
in nature. There may be powerful and wealthy entities willing to expend signi�cant
e�ort and spend a lot of money to compromise this use case in particular. However,
despite this challenge, an optimised veri�cation process can solve this.

10.5 Illegal Content
The challenge with illegal content is that it may have di�erent legality status in dif-
ferent countries. In addition, some content may be age restricted. Country and age
related issues can in many ways be solved at the user interface level. For overtly ille-
gal content, a separate, yet similar, veri�cation process to that described above will be
required. The process can resolve this issue given su�cient optimisation and perhaps
added functionality. However, there must be a centralised system to begin with, as
there is with all other content platforms. The intention is not to arbitrarily censor any
content, except in �agrant violations.

10.6 Vulnerability to Sybil Attack
In order for this system to be resistant to Sybil attack, then the reward for poor veri�ca-
tions must be small whilst the penalty for lying is large. We must also lock the bene�ts
up for su�cient time in order to make a Sybil attack extremely expensive to maintain.

22



As bad actors attack the system, the potential reward for truthful people grows rapidly.
This e�ectively skews the payo� matrix in favour of ‘defecting’, i.e. creating an incen-
tive for bad actors to ‘change sides’ in light of the much greater potential rewards. As
such, the system contains a natural limit beyond which Sybil attacks become uneco-
nomic.

The system must be thoroughly tested and optimised, working under all market con-
ditions and with su�cient speed (via o�-chain transactions). It must also work even
if the content is of extremely high value. It is critical that we trial this system for
some time before we consider deprecating our tokens. As such, this system will be an
open-sourced but temporarily centralised solution.

23



11 Transparency
With the intention of fostering trust and transparency, the dynamics and KPI’s af-
fecting Hubii Network will be fully visible and accessible to anyone. This way users
will have access to live statistics of the key parameters a�ecting the trading of Hubiits
through our Transparency Dashboard.

Thus, Gross Market Volume (GMV) describing the total Hubiits being transacted within
Hubii Network, Net Promoter Score (NPS) covering the supply and demand with cre-
ators, distributors and consumers, Ful�llment Rate (FR) describing the fraction of cus-
tomer demand that is met through immediate stock availability and Consumer Growth
Rate (CGR) will be available within the Transparency Dashboard.

13 Token Launch
Hubii Network is specifying a maximum cap of $50m USD to be raised in the token sale.
When we talk of a USD amount, this will in reality be a �xed amount of Ether (ETH),
set according to the price of ETH before the sale contract is deployed to the Ethereum
network. The maximum target would allow the Hubii Network to scale quickly and
maximise our potential to build a signi�cant network e�ect before competition arose.

We will be setting a minimum target of $5m. This minimum target would still allow
the team to develop some minimum viable products, but it is likely that extra funding
would be needed, by more conventional venture capital routes. There will not be an-
other token sale for Hubiits and the Hubiits generated by the token sale will be all the
Hubiits that ever exist.

The sale will be open for 2 weeks from the opening block number, which will be an-
nounced 48 hours before the sale begins.

All transactions will be treated on a �rst-come-�rst-serve basis, but also according
to the wills of the miners who include the transactions in their block.

The fraction of total generated tokens that are for sale in this project is 70%.

10% of the generated tokens will be reserved for key team members and advisors.

5% of the tokens will be held as a liquidity pool for the platform.

5% of the tokens will be used in the �rst year in building partnerships which will be
critical for the success of the platform.

The remaining 10% of tokens will have vesting periods attached to them and will be
used as further platform funding as well as for building partnerships. 5% will be locked
up for exactly one year from the date of the sale. 5% will be locked up for 2 years from
the sale date.

Below is a chart showing the token splits :

26



Figure 3: Token splits

The following �gures are based on an ETH price as of 14th July - $200

13.1 Minimum target
Fixed ETH amount TBC

13.2 ETH volatility
As the price of ETH is extremely volatile currently, and we are setting a �xed goal in
USD, we cannot guarantee the exact number of ETH that would equate to our targets.
As is the standard approach, we will take the ETH USD price as close as possible to
the token sale and lock in the number of ETH to be accepted at that point. This price
lock-in will be made public before the sale begins.

13.3 Exchange rate
The exchange rate of Hubiits to ETH will be set at 1,000.

13.4 Tokens generated
We cannot guarantee the total number of tokens to be generated by the sale, as this
will depend upon the prevailing price of ETH in USD. However assuming the above
�gures then we would have a minimum of 35,714,286 HUB generated and 35,714,286
HUB per extra phase (including the tokens not for public sale).

27



13.5 Launch date and time
The token sale will go live at approximately 16:00 (CET) 24th August 2017. As the sale
timing will be determined by a block number, we cannot exactly guarantee the time.
The exact block number for the beginning of the sale will be visible when the
contract is deployed to the network for public audit. We will also publish this
on the website before the sale begins.

13.6 Contract address
In order to take part in the sale a purchaser must send ETH to an address which will
be published for public audit.

13.7 Gas Limit
Along with the contract address, a recommended gas limit to be sent as part of the
transaction will also be published. This will ensure that nobody misses out on the sale
due to the gas requirements of the contract.

13.8 Refunds
Any ETH that is sent before the contract begins, or after the target has been reached,
will be rejected. However, we cannot refund the transaction gas, as this will be con-
sumed by the miners.

13.9 Sale timing
Due to the complex situation surrounding the Bitcoin ecosystem at this time and during
the early part of August, there is a small chance we might be forced to postpone the
sale. This will only happen in a worst case scenario where it is di�cult for people
to move around their bitcoin on the lead up to the actual sale.

14 Hubiit FAQs

14.1 What is a Hubiit?
A Hubiit is an ERC20 token and will be the native currency of the Hubii Network. They
will be sold to potential users of the Hubii Network to be utilised on the platform. The
tokens will be non-refundable. They do not represent any equity in the company. They
will be the only way to engage with various platform features. There is no guarantee
that Hubiits will have any particular value in the future and should be purchased only
for their utility and not as an investment.

14.2 Will there be any future Hubiit token sales?
No, this is a one time event. Once all Hubiits are issued then no more will be generated.
These tokens will �nd their true market value and enable the trading of the best content
in the world. As discussed previously the number of tokens produced will depend upon
the value of ETH at the time of the sale, as we have a �xed target in USD.

14.3 What currencies will be accepted to purchase Hubiits?
You must purchase Hubiits using ETH, sent to the smart contract as described above.

14.4 Why does the Hubii Network need a native token?
Innovation in the ecosystem has so far been very heavily focused at the protocol level.
However, in order to drive this ecosystem forward it is time to focus on practical and
real world usage of those protocols that have been developed. Bitcoin was, and is, a
leading example of how a cryptocurrency can exhibit all the characteristics that are
needed for a currency. Ethereum is a platform upon which we can build a token. All
the parts are now in place to disrupt entire industries. The token will have utility in
the platform’s veri�cation system and also in mitigating exchange rate risk. One other
powerful reason for a native cryptocurrency or token to be used on the Hubii Network
is that we can provide real time information on the media trade volume that is passing
through the system. Also key to our choice is an intention to later deprecate our ERC20
token as we want to fully decentralise our more unique platform features.

14.5 Why are we con�dent Hubii can change the industry?
The content industry will never be ruled by a monopoly. Furthermore there are data
points indicating that a content agnostic platform is what consumers prefer. Blockchain
plays a key role in maximising the e�ciency of the marketplace in the future. The

29



system will develop a strong and necessary network e�ect and this is why Hubii has
aggressive plans to roll out and scale.

14.6 How will Hubii hold the funds collected?
Hubii will hold the ETH raised according to best practices, so a hardware wallet and
multisig addresses.

14.7 What safeguards are in place to ensure the contract is cor-
rect?

Hubii are employing some of the best contract creators in the space. We are also ensur-
ing that we undertake a full audit and testing of the contract. This is key to why Hubii
is also choosing to follow the ERC20 token standards. Details of the smart contract
audit report will be revealed before the sale.

14.8 Will Hubiits be transferrable?
In order for the currency to �nd its own value, it is critical that Hubiits are transferable
without any restrictions.

14.9 How ambitious are we?
We are extremely ambitious and con�dent that we can succeed in our endeavours. As
an example of our ambition, we have suggested that we can crowdfund movies, allow-
ing revenues to be shared back to token holders. This is not a trustless solution; you
are relying on the people who received funding to actually make the movie and then
distribute pro�ts back to the investors.

We suggest that eventually the Hubii Network will allow funding to be released to the
movie-makers in various stages, perhaps with investors voting to disseminate funds.
This can help limit the risk of the movie-makers failing to deliver on their promises.

However, how do we ensure that we give revenue back to the token holders? We
enforce this by taking this revenue at source. The point-of-sale terminal at the cinema
will automatically cash into the Hubii Network and distribute revenue live to the in-
vestors. This would be a classic use case for payment channels. The POS20 device would
open up a payment channel for the maximum revenue share from a single screening
of the movie. As tickets were purchased, a small fraction of the revenue can be sent

20Point of sale

30



directly to the investor’s fund. Once the movie is fully booked, or is closed to further
sales, the payment channel can be closed. This means that potentially hundreds of
microtransactions can take place for minimal cost and can be done with just two on
chain transactions.

We feel con�dent in our approach and philosophy therefore, should we raise a mini-
mum of $15M through our token sale, we shall create a smart contract within Hubii
Network whereby if an article published within the platform ought to win the Pulitzer
prize, the author will be rewarded with $100,000. We expect this would add much more
than $100,000 of value to the platform, purely in terms of publicity.

14.10 Philosophy
We believe in open source and fully decentralised solutions. This will not be immedi-
ately possible, but we will eventually make the entire product this way. We trust that
our network e�ect, industry support and experience will make us the default option
amongst our competitors and clones.

We will need to use the best available solutions for all aspects of the platform. There is
no point reinventing the wheel and so we will use third parties to assist where possible.
This could be a fully decentralised and open source storage solution, but it could also
be an integrated digital wallet and decentralised exchange built on the best available
service. This would give many potential bene�ts such as increased liquidity, greater
functionality and interoperability.

We want to make this platform incredibly intuitive and easy to use. We intend that
the platform is easy for any users to interact with. Smart contracts will be simple pro-
cesses where the user selects a template and a few simple options. Purchasing content
or entering into a contract will be clear, easy and quick.

31



15 Budget Allocation
We foresee the following allocation of funds for the development of Hubii Network.

• Development Team; consisting of 14 engineers working in the development of
Hubii Network.

• Business Development Team; consisting of 6 Senior BD people establishing dis-
tribution partnerships and focusing on content acquisition and monetisation.

• Administration; Accounting and other administration costs.

• Contingency; Unforeseen costs.

• Community; If we raise over 50% of our target we will set up a content creation
foundation of 0.7% of our �nances. The foundation will be a community based
initiative.

16 Afterword

“ In 2017 it is too easy to come up with examples of why online mediaand publishing is broken. It is not only ‘fake news’ and diminishing trust,nor is it only failing newspapers or creators not being compensated well.
The fundamental model of a ‘distributor and content creator’ as a cred-
ible source, the concept of an ‘curator’ who decides what gets published,
creators contracted to produce a certain amount of content before a dead-
line, the business and revenue models designed for the o�ine world. It is
all disappearing.

Instead there is Hubii Network, promising a level playing �eld for creators,
distributors and consumers, where the crowd is incentivised to validate all
content, where credibility of a source is earned – not purchased, and where
the vast majority of value created goes to the active participants. We like to
think of Hubii Network as the ‘democratisation’ of the online content mar-
ketplace, a democracy ensured by transparency and sound marketplace
mechanisms, by IP rights and authenticity where the ‘attention economy’
works to the bene�t of all participants. ”

17 Appendix

17.1 Volatility of Hubiits
A deep dive into the dynamics of virtual currencies was recently carried out by economists
Bolt and van Oordt.21 In particular the exchange rates of virtual currencies relative to
�at currencies was found to depend on the following three components:

• The use of the currency as a medium of exchange, i.e., to make payments

• Investors’ buying the currency for speculative reasons, and thus e�ectively reg-
ulating the amount of currency used to settle payments

• Elements that drive future consumer adoption and merchant acceptance of the
currency

Their analysis was discussed recently in the context of the Basic Attention Token
(BAT)22, and the conclusions equally well apply for Hubiits.

A key �nding of Bolt and van Oordt’s study is that virtual currencies exchange rates
to �at currencies increase proportionally to the volume of payments carried out with
the virtual currency and inversely proportional to the fraction of the total amount of
currency in circulation. In other words, the currency not held in speculative positions
by investors. Thus with increased number of transactions the exchange rates are dom-
inated by transactions rather than by speculative positions, a pattern that has been
observed in seasoned virtual currencies. The analysis argues for long term price sta-
bility in token mediated economies such as the one of Hubii Network, which aims to
primarily be a platform for exchange of content.

Core metrics describing the usage and long term trends of Hubiits will be displayed
in a transparency dashboard implementation for the bene�t of users, merchants and
speculators alike. The beauty of using a native token on the Hubii Network is that we
can demonstrate the extent to which Hubiits is used to mediate trade volume on our
network. All token holders can use the Equation of Exchange along with this infor-
mation to estimate a fair price level for the token. It is natural that a virtual currency
can exhibit a speculative value, as �at currencies also can, but market participants will
be able to estimate the price level for below which there might be upwards market
pressure.

We expect that until the market grows su�ciently for Hubiits to be primarily a medium
of exchange (and not a speculative asset), we will have to explore ways of showing
prices in a user’s familiar currency of choice. As described above in ’Removing ex-
change rate risk’, we will o�er the facility for stakeholders to ’lock’ their network
activity to some �at currencies. As we see, Bitcoin is still very volatile after 8 years
(which is great for speculators). As such, we do not expect Hubiits volatility to be only
short term.
